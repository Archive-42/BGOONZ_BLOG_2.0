For example:</p>\n<p><code>cowsay \"Hello\"</code> will print</p>\n<pre><code> _______\n&#x3C; Hello >\n -------\n        \\   ^__^\n         \\  (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n</code></pre>\n<p>This only works if you have the <code>cowsay</code> command globally installed from npm previously. Otherwise you'll get an error when you try to run the command.</p>\n<p><code>npx</code> allows you to run that npm command without having it installed locally:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx cowsay \"Hello\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>will do the job.</p>\n<p>Now, this is a funny useless command.\nOther scenarios include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>running the <code>vue</code> CLI tool to create new applications and run them: <code>npx @vue/cli create my-vue-app</code></li>\n<li>creating a new React app using <code>create-react-app</code>: <code>npx create-react-app my-react-app</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>and many more.</p>\n<p>Once downloaded, the downloaded code will be wiped.</p>\n<h2>Run some code using a different Node.js version</h2>\n<p>Use the <code>@</code> to specify the version, and combine that with the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node\"><code>node</code> npm package</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx node@10 -v #v10.18.1\nnpx node@12 -v #v12.14.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>This helps to avoid tools like <code>nvm</code> or the other Node.js version management tools.</p>\n<h2>Run arbitrary code snippets directly from a URL</h2>\n<p><code>npx</code> does not limit you to the packages published on the npm registry.</p>\n<p>You can run code that sits in a GitHub gist, for example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx https://gist.github.com/zkat/4bc19503fe9e9309e2bfaa2c58074d32\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, you need to be careful when running code that you do not control, as with great power comes great responsibility.</p>"
