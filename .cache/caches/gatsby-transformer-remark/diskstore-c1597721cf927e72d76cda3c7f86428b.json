This means that all the information about your request must be included in the request headers; the server doesn't remember anything you told it last time. This is one reason that HTTP and the web have been so successful. It is very easy to implement an HTTP server and it can be done on very small devices. This might be one of the reasons why the Web succeeded where other similar systems failed. Since the protocol is so simple, it was easy to write a web server and many people did. This meant that the web was used by many small groups to publish content, forming the groundswell that led to institutional and corporate adoption.","position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":1,"offset":10818},"end":{"line":57,"column":731,"offset":11548},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":1,"offset":10818},"end":{"line":57,"column":731,"offset":11548},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"We'll look at HTTP in more detail later, for now the take home message is:","position":{"start":{"line":59,"column":1,"offset":11550},"end":{"line":59,"column":75,"offset":11624},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":59,"column":1,"offset":11550},"end":{"line":59,"column":75,"offset":11624},"indent":[]}},{"type":"list","ordered":false,"start":null,"spread":true,"children":[{"type":"listItem","spread":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"HTTP is a simple text based protocol","position":{"start":{"line":61,"column":5,"offset":11630},"end":{"line":61,"column":41,"offset":11666},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":61,"column":5,"offset":11630},"end":{"line":61,"column":41,"offset":11666},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":61,"column":1,"offset":11626},"end":{"line":62,"column":1,"offset":11667},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"listItem","spread":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The client (browser) sends a request to the server","position":{"start":{"line":63,"column":5,"offset":11672},"end":{"line":63,"column":55,"offset":11722},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":63,"column":5,"offset":11672},"end":{"line":63,"column":55,"offset":11722},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":63,"column":1,"offset":11668},"end":{"line":64,"column":1,"offset":11723},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"listItem","spread":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The server receives the request and returns a response","position":{"start":{"line":65,"column":5,"offset":11728},"end":{"line":65,"column":59,"offset":11782},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":65,"column":5,"offset":11728},"end":{"line":65,"column":59,"offset":11782},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":65,"column":1,"offset":11724},"end":{"line":66,"column":1,"offset":11783},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"listItem","spread":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The server doesn't need to remember the client - every request is independant.","position":{"start":{"line":67,"column":5,"offset":11788},"end":{"line":67,"column":83,"offset":11866},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":67,"column":5,"offset":11788},"end":{"line":67,"column":83,"offset":11866},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":67,"column":1,"offset":11784},"end":{"line":68,"column":1,"offset":11867},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"listItem","spread":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The simple nature of HTTP makes it easy to understand and makes writing web servers relatively easy.","position":{"start":{"line":69,"column":5,"offset":11872},"end":{"line":69,"column":105,"offset":11972},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":69,"column":5,"offset":11872},"end":{"line":69,"column":105,"offset":11972},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":69,"column":1,"offset":11868},"end":{"line":69,"column":105,"offset":11972},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":61,"column":1,"offset":11626},"end":{"line":69,"column":105,"offset":11972},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Uniform Resource Locators: URL","position":{"start":{"line":71,"column":4,"offset":11977},"end":{"line":71,"column":34,"offset":12007},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":71,"column":1,"offset":11974},"end":{"line":71,"column":34,"offset":12007},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Another part of Tim Berners-Lee's invention is the Uniform Resource Locator, URL.
