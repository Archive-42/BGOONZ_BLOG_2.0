Memoization, Tabulation, and Sorting Algorithms by Example
                Why is looking at runtime not a reliable method of calculating time
                complexity?

                # Break Even Nuclear Fusion Candidate
                In December, researchers at the Joint European Torus (JET) started
                conducting fusion experiments with tritium — a rare and radioactive
                isotope of hydrogen. The facility is a one-tenth-volume mock-up of the
                US$22-billion ITER project and has the same doughnut-shaped 'tokamak'
                design — the world's most developed approach to fusion energy. It is
                the first time since 1997 that researchers have done experiments in a
                tokamak with any significant amount of tritium.
