## PostgreSQL Cheat Sheet

### **Each table is made up of rows and columns. If you think of a table as a grid, the column go from left to right across the grid and each entry of data is listed down as a row.**

Each row in a relational is uniquely identified by a primary key. This can be by one or more sets of column values. In most scenarios it is a single column, such as employeeID.

Every relational table has one primary key. Its purpose is to uniquely identify each row in the database. No two rows can have the same primary key value. The practical result of this is that you can select every single row by just knowing its primary key.

SQL Server UNIQUE constraints allow you to ensure that the data stored in a column, or a group of columns, is unique among the rows in a table.

Although both UNIQUE and [PRIMARY KEY](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-primary-key/) constraints enforce the uniqueness of data, you should use the UNIQUE constraint instead of PRIMARY KEY constraint when you want to enforce the uniqueness of a column, or a group of columns, that are not the primary key columns.

Different from PRIMARY KEY constraints, UNIQUE constraints allow NULL. Moreover, UNIQUE constraints treat the NULL as a regular value, therefore, it only allows one NULL per column.

## Managing indexes

Creating an index with the specified name on a table

```text
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX index_name
ON table (column,...)
```

Removing a specified index from a table

```text
DROP INDEX index_name;
```

## Querying data from tables

Query all data from a table:

```text
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

Query data from specified columns of all rows in a table:

```text
SELECT column_list
FROM table;
```

Query data and select only unique rows:

```text
SELECT DISTINCT (column)
FROM table;
```

Query data from a table with a filter:

```text
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE condition;
```

Assign an [alias](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-alias/) to a column in the result set:

```text
SELECT column_1 AS new_column_1, ...
FROM table;
```

Query data using the `LIKE` operator:

```text
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column LIKE '%value%'
```

Query data using the `BETWEEN`operator:

```text
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column BETWEEN low AND high;
```

Query data using the `IN`operator:

```text
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column IN (value1, value2,...);
```

Constrain the returned rows with the `LIMIT` clause:

```text
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT limit OFFSET offset
ORDER BY column_name;
```

Query data from multiple using the [inner join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-inner-join/), [left join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-left-join/), [full outer join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-full-outer-join/), [cross join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-cross-join/) and [natural join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-natural-join/):

ORDER BY column ASC [DESC], column2 ASC [DESC],...;
```

Group rows using `GROUP BY` clause.

```text
SELECT *
FROM table
GROUP BY column_1, column_2, ...;
```

Filter groups using the `HAVING` clause.

```text
SELECT *

GROUP BY column_1
HAVING condition;
```

## Set operations

Combine the result set of two or more queries with `UNION` operator:

```

Minus a result set using `EXCEPT` operator:

```text
SELECT * FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM table2;
```

Get intersection of the result sets of two queries:

VALUES(value_1,value_2,...);
```

Insert multiple rows into a table:

```text
INSERT INTO table_name(column1,column2,...)
VALUES(value_1,value_2,...),
      (value_1,value_2,...),
      (value_1,value_2,...)...
```

[Update](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-update/) data for all rows:

```text
UPDATE table_name
SET column_1 = value_1,
    ...;
```

Update data for a set of rows specified by a condition in the `WHERE` clause.

```

Show and execute the query plan for a query:

```text
EXPLAIN ANALYZE query;
```

Collect statistics:

ANALYZE table_name;
```

## Postgres & JSON:

## Creating the DB and the Table

```text
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
CREATE DATABASE books_db WITH ENCODING='UTF8' TEMPLATE template0;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;

CREATE TABLE books (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  client VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  data JSONb NOT NULL
);
```

## Populating the DB

```text
INSERT INTO books(client, data) values( 'Joe', '{ "title": "Siddhartha", "author": { "first_name": "Herman", "last_name": "Hesse" } }' ); INSERT INTO books(client, data) values('Jenny', '{ "title": "Bryan Guner", "author": { "first_name": "Jack", "last_name": "Kerouac" } }'); INSERT INTO books(client, data) values('Jenny', '{ "title": "100 aÃ±os de soledad", "author": { "first_name": "Gabo", "last_name": "MarquÃ©z" } }');
```

Lets see everything inside the table books:

```text
SELECT * FROM books;
```

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GOQQ0qNGak2yIrtQ)\#\#\# `->` operator returns values out of JSON columns

Selecting 1 column:

```text
SELECT client, 
    data->'title' AS title
    FROM books;
```

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OIVYOfYcbVh65Mt5)Selecting 2 columns:

```text
SELECT client, 
   data->'title' AS title, data->'author' AS author
   FROM books;
```

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fEzPkSY8yGexKOk4)\#\#\# `->` vs `->>`

The `->` operator returns the original JSON type \(which might be an object\), whereas `->>` returns text.

## Return NESTED objects

You can use the `->` to return a nested object and thus chain the operators:

```text
SELECT client, 
   data->'author'->'last_name' AS author
   FROM books;
```

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*lwy8bR7igaroMXeb)\#\#\# Filtering

Select rows based on a value inside your JSON:

```text
SELECT 
 client,
 data->'title' AS title
 FROM books
  WHERE data->'title' = '"Bryan Guner"';
```

Notice WHERE uses `->` so we must compare to JSON `'"Bryan Guner"'`

Or we could use `->>` and compare to `'Bryan Guner'`

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*poASndLoU71qlXqE)\#\#\# Nested filtering

Find rows based on the value of a nested JSON object:

```text
SELECT 
 client,
 data->'title' AS title
 FROM books
  WHERE data->'author'->>'last_name' = 'Kerouac';
```

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*R1kOhDK19ntdUYkq)\#\#\# A real world example

```text
CREATE TABLE events (
  name varchar(200),
  visitor_id varchar(200),
  properties json,
  browser json
);
```

Weâre going to store events in this table, like pageviews. Each event has properties, which could be anything \(e.g. current page\) and also sends information about the browser \(like OS, screen resolution, etc\). Both of these are completely free form and could change over time \(as we think of extra stuff to track\).

```text
INSERT INTO events VALUES (
  'pageview', '1',
  '{ "page": "/" }',
  '{ "name": "Chrome", "os": "Mac", "resolution": { "x": 1440, "y": 900 } }'
);
INSERT INTO events VALUES (
  'pageview', '2',
  '{ "page": "/" }',
  '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1920, "y": 1200 } }'
);
INSERT INTO events VALUES (
  'pageview', '1',
  '{ "page": "/account" }',
  '{ "name": "Chrome", "os": "Mac", "resolution": { "x": 1440, "y": 900 } }'
);
INSERT INTO events VALUES (
  'purchase', '5',
  '{ "amount": 10 }',
  '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1024, "y": 768 } }'
);
INSERT INTO events VALUES (
  'purchase', '15',
  '{ "amount": 200 }',
  '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1280, "y": 800 } }'
);
INSERT INTO events VALUES (
  'purchase', '15',
  '{ "amount": 500 }',
  '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1280, "y": 800 } }'
);
```

Now lets select everything:

```text
SELECT * FROM events;
```

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZPHfB4FxjSIlAVxL)\#\#\# JSON operators + PostgreSQL aggregate functions

Using the JSON operators, combined with traditional PostgreSQL aggregate functions, we can pull out whatever we want. You have the full might of an RDBMS at your disposal.

* Lets see browser usage:
* `SELECT browser->>'name' AS browser, count(browser) FROM events GROUP BY browser->>'name';`

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4lEv2DgUk33FeUgo)- Total revenue per visitor:

`SELECT visitor_id, SUM(CAST(properties->>'amount' AS integer)) AS total FROM events WHERE CAST(properties->>'amount' AS integer) > 0 GROUP BY visitor_id;`

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HxOS3CgwXBJ6A2FP)- Average screen resolution

* `SELECT AVG(CAST(browser->'resolution'->>'x' AS integer)) AS width, AVG(CAST(browser->'resolution'->>'y' AS integer)) AS height FROM events;`

Output:
