# features

 **Note:** This is the demo content for demonstration purpose only. The primary function of this content is to show you what this theme can do. There is a more detailed explanation in the **Getting Started** section.

## Code Blocks

Blocks of code are either fenced by `lines with three back-ticks`, or are indented with four spaces.

```text

```
body {
  background: #fff;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.66667; }

a {
  color: #d4a259;
  text-decoration: underline;
  -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease;
  transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease; }

a:hover {
  color: #1d1d1d;
  text-decoration: none; }
```
```

The rendered output looks like this:

```text
body {
  background: #fff;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.66667; }

a {
  color: #d4a259;
  text-decoration: underline;
  -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease;
  transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease; }

a:hover {
  color: #1d1d1d;
  text-decoration: none; }
```

## Callouts

There are two types of callouts available in this theme, **important** and **note**.

 **Important:** This is an "Important" callout block of text. This block indicates a warning or caution. Use it for an important message.

 **Note:** This is a "Note" callout block of text. This block signifies a general note or tip.

## Tables

You can build tables with markdown to help you organize information. To add a table, use three or more hyphens \(---\) to create each column’s header, and use pipes \(\|\) to separate each column like in the example below.

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| type | Required | `enum` | The type of the model. Must be one of - `page`, `config`, `data`, `object` |
| label | Required | `string` | The label of the model |
| description |  | `string` | Description of the model. Used by some CMS. |
| fields |  | `list` of `objects` | List of Field Models |
