# plug-ins

 **Note:** This is the demo content for demonstration purpose only. The primary function of this content is to show you what this theme can do. There is a more detailed explanation in the **Getting Started** section.

## Code Blocks

Blocks of code are either fenced by `lines with three back-ticks`, or are indented with four spaces.

```text

```
body {
  background: #fff;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.66667; }

a {
  color: #d4a259;
  text-decoration: underline;
  -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease;
  transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease; }

a:hover {
  color: #1d1d1d;
  text-decoration: none; }
```
```

The rendered output looks like this:

```text
body {
  background: #fff;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.66667; }

a {
  color: #d4a259;
  text-decoration: underline;
  -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease;
  transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease; }

a:hover {
  color: #1d1d1d;
  text-decoration: none; }
```

## Tables

You can build tables with markdown to help you organize information. To add a table, use three or more hyphens \(---\) to create each columnâ€™s header, and use pipes \(\|\) to separate each column like in the example below.

```text

| Title | Title |
| ------| ----- |
| Text  | Text  |
| Text  | Text  |
```

| Title | Title |
| :--- | :--- |
| Text | Text |
| Text | Text |
