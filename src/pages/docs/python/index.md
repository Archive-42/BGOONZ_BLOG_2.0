### Python Study Guide for a JavaScript Programmer

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3V9VOfPk_hrFdbEAd3j-QQ.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Applications of Tutorial & Cheat Sheet Respectivley (At Bottom Of Tutorial):

### Basics

-   <span id="f893">**PEP8**¬†: Python Enhancement Proposals, style-guide for Python.</span>
-   <span id="c0bf">`print` is the equivalent of `console.log`.</span>

> ‚Äòprint() == console.log()‚Äô

### `#` is used to make comments in your¬†code.

    def foo():
        """
        The foo function does many amazing things that you
        should not question. Just accept that it exists and
        use it with caution.
        """
        secretThing()

> _Python has a built in help function that let‚Äôs you see a description of the source code without having to navigate to it‚Ä¶ ‚Äú-SickNasty¬†‚Ä¶ Autor Unknown‚Äù_

---

### Numbers

-   <span id="4060">Python has three types of numbers:</span>

1.  <span id="8aef">**Integer**</span>
2.  <span id="723f">**Positive and Negative Counting Numbers.**</span>

No Decimal Point

> Created by a literal non-decimal point number¬†‚Ä¶ **or**¬†‚Ä¶ with the `int()` constructor.

    print(3) # => 3
    print(int(19)) # => 19
    print(int()) # => 0

**3. Complex Numbers**

> Consist of a real part and imaginary part.

#### Boolean is a subtype of integer in Python.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

> If you came from a background in JavaScript and learned to accept the premise(s) of the following meme‚Ä¶

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*eC4EvZcv6hhH88jX.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Than I am sure you will find the means to suspend your disbelief.

    print(2.24) # => 2.24
    print(2.) # => 2.0
    print(float()) # => 0.0
    print(27e-5) # => 0.00027

### KEEP IN¬†MIND:

> **The** `i` **is switched to a** `j` **in programming.**

<span class="graf-dropCap">T</span>\*his is because the letter i is common place as the de facto index for any and all enumerable entities so it just makes sense not to compete for name-\***_space_** _when there‚Äôs another 25 letters that don‚Äôt get used for every loop under the sun. My most medium apologies to Leonhard Euler._

    print(7j) # => 7j
    print(5.1+7.7j)) # => 5.1+7.7j
    print(complex(3, 5)) # => 3+5j
    print(complex(17)) # => 17+0j
    print(complex()) # => 0j

-   <span id="2579">**Type Casting**¬†: The process of converting one number to another.</span>

<!-- -->

    # Using Float
    print(17)               # => 17
    print(float(17))        # => 17.0

    # Using Int
    print(17.0)             # => 17.0
    print(int(17.0))        # => 17

    # Using Str
    print(str(17.0) + ' and ' + str(17))        # => 17.0 and 17

**The arithmetic operators are the same between JS and Python, with two additions:**

-   <span id="8cf4">_‚Äú\*\*‚Äù¬†: Double asterisk for exponent._</span>
-   <span id="03b4">_‚Äú//‚Äù¬†: Integer Division._</span>
-   <span id="2ce5">**There are no spaces between math operations in Python.**</span>
-   <span id="1686">**Integer Division gives the other part of the number from Module; it is a way to do round down numbers replacing** `Math.floor()` **in JS.**</span>
-   <span id="a6a3">**There are no** `++` **and** `--` **in Python, the only shorthand operators are:**</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*Ez_1PZ93N4FfvkRr.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>

---

### Strings

-   <span id="e98c">Python uses both single and double quotes.</span>
-   <span id="225e">You can escape strings like so `'Jodi asked, "What\'s up, Sam?"'`</span>
-   <span id="9f74">Multiline strings use triple quotes.</span>

<!-- -->

    print('''My instructions are very long so to make them
    more readable in the code I am putting them on
    more than one line. I can even include "quotes"
    of any kind because they won't get confused with
    the end of the string!''')

**Use the** `len()` **function to get the length of a string.**

    print(len(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù)) # => 9

### **Python uses** `zero-based indexing`

#### Python allows negative indexing (thank¬†god!)

    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[-1]) # => i

    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[-4]) # => e

-   <span id="7567">Python let‚Äôs you use ranges</span>

You can think of this as roughly equivalent to the slice method called on a JavaScript object or string‚Ä¶ _(mind you that in JS¬†‚Ä¶ strings are wrapped in an object (under the hood)‚Ä¶ upon which the string methods are actually called. As a immutable privative type_ **\*by textbook definition\*\***, a string literal could not hope to invoke most of it‚Äôs methods without violating the state it was bound to on initialization if it were not for this bit of syntactic sugar.)\*

    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[1:4]) # => pag
    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[4:-1]) # => hett
    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[4:4]) # => (empty string)

-   <span id="1366">The end range is exclusive just like `slice` in JS.</span>

<!-- -->

    # Shortcut to get from the beginning of a string to a certain index.
    print("Spaghetti"[:4])  # => Spag
    print("Spaghetti"[:-1])    # => Spaghett

    # Shortcut to get from a certain index to the end of a string.
    print("Spaghetti"[1:])  # => paghetti
    print("Spaghetti"[-4:])    # => etti

-   <span id="c786">The `index` string function is the equiv. of `indexOf()` in JS</span>

<!-- -->

    print("Spaghetti".index("h"))    # => 4
    print("Spaghetti".index("t"))    # => 6

-   <span id="fbb6">The `count` function finds out how many times a substring appears in a string‚Ä¶ pretty nifty for a hard coded feature of the language.</span>

<!-- -->

    print("Spaghetti".count("h"))    # => 1
    print("Spaghetti".count("t"))    # => 2
    print("Spaghetti".count("s"))    # => 0
    print('''We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
    not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will
    serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that
    challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
    postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
    '''.count('the '))                # => 4

-   <span id="7816">**You can use** `+` **to concatenate strings, just like in JS.**</span>
-   <span id="ed0a">**You can also use ‚Äú\*‚Äù to repeat strings or multiply strings.**</span>
-   <span id="f95c">**Use the** `format()` **function to use placeholders in a string to input values later on.**</span>

<!-- -->

    first_name = "Billy"
    last_name = "Bob"
    print('Your name is {0} {1}'.format(first_name, last_name))  # => Your name is Billy Bob

-   <span id="445b">_Shorthand way to use format function is:  
    _`print(f'Your name is {first_name} {last_name}')`</span>

#### Some useful string¬†methods.

-   <span id="118c">**Note that in JS** `join` **is used on an Array, in Python it is used on String.**</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*eE3E5H0AoqkhqK1z.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="e95e">There are also many handy testing methods.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Q0CMqFd4PozLDFPB.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>

---

### Variables and Expressions

-   <span id="a255">**Duck-Typing**¬†: Programming Style which avoids checking an object‚Äôs type to figure out what it can do.</span>
-   <span id="6e70">Duck Typing is the fundamental approach of Python.</span>
-   <span id="5666">Assignment of a value automatically declares a variable.</span>

<!-- -->

    a = 7
    b = 'Marbles'
    print(a)         # => 7
    print(b)         # => Marbles

-   <span id="f6cf">**_You can chain variable assignments to give multiple var names the same value._**</span>

#### Use with caution as this is highly unreadable

    count = max = min = 0
    print(count)           # => 0
    print(max)             # => 0
    print(min)             # => 0

#### The value and type of a variable can be re-assigned at any¬†time.

    a = 17
    print(a)         # => 17
    a = 'seventeen'
    print(a)         # => seventeen

-   <span id="4605">`NaN` _does not exist in Python, but you can 'create' it like so:  
    _`print(float("nan"))`</span>
-   <span id="d150">_Python replaces_ `null` _with_ `none`_._</span>
-   <span id="6fa7">`none` **_is an object_** _and can be directly assigned to a variable._</span>

> Using none is a convenient way to check to see why an action may not be operating correctly in your program.

---

### Boolean Data¬†Type

-   <span id="b843">One of the biggest benefits of Python is that it reads more like English than JS does.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HQpndNhm1Z_xSoHb.png" class="graf-image" /></figure># Logical AND
    print(True and True)    # => True
    print(True and False)   # => False
    print(False and False)  # => False

    # Logical OR
    print(True or True)     # => True
    print(True or False)    # => True
    print(False or False)   # => False

    # Logical NOT
    print(not True)             # => False
    print(not False and True)   # => True
    print(not True or False)    # => False

-   <span id="18cc">By default, Python considers an object to be true UNLESS it is one of the following:</span>
-   <span id="6e0a">Constant `None` or `False`</span>
-   <span id="9552">Zero of any numeric type.</span>
-   <span id="e7ce">Empty Sequence or Collection.</span>
-   <span id="11d6">`True` and `False` must be capitalized</span>

---

### Comparison Operators

-   <span id="a4fa">Python uses all the same equality operators as JS.</span>
-   <span id="7f98">In Python, equality operators are processed from left to right.</span>
-   <span id="fb68">Logical operators are processed in this order:</span>

1.  <span id="bf08">**NOT**</span>
2.  <span id="4888">**AND**</span>
3.  <span id="2c55">**OR**</span>

> Just like in JS, you can use `parentheses` to change the inherent order of operations.

> **Short Circuit**¬†: Stopping a program when a `true` or `false` has been reached.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qHzGRLTOMTf30miT.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>

---

### Identity vs¬†Equality

    print (2 == '2')    # => False
    print (2 is '2')    # => False

    print ("2" == '2')    # => True
    print ("2" is '2')    # => True

    # There is a distinction between the number types.
    print (2 == 2.0)    # => True
    print (2 is 2.0)    # => False

-   <span id="c5a5">In the Python community it is better to use `is` and `is not` over `==` or¬†`!=`</span>

---

### If Statements

    if name == 'Monica':
        print('Hi, Monica.')

    if name == 'Monica':
        print('Hi, Monica.')
    else:
        print('Hello, stranger.')

    if name == 'Monica':
        print('Hi, Monica.')
    elif age < 12:
        print('You are not Monica, kiddo.')
    elif age > 2000:
       print('Unlike you, Monica is not an undead, immortal vampire.')
    elif age > 100:
       print('You are not Monica, grannie.')

> Remember the order of `elif` statements matter.

---

### While Statements

    spam = 0
    while spam < 5:
      print('Hello, world.')
      spam = spam + 1

-   <span id="c7f3">`Break` statement also exists in Python.</span>

<!-- -->

    spam = 0
    while True:
      print('Hello, world.')
      spam = spam + 1
      if spam >= 5:
        break

-   <span id="7a99">As are `continue` statements</span>

<!-- -->

    spam = 0
    while True:
      print('Hello, world.')
      spam = spam + 1
      if spam < 5:
        continue
      break

---

### Try/Except Statements

-   <span id="72ec">Python equivalent to `try/catch`</span>

<!-- -->

    a = 321
    try:
        print(len(a))
    except:
        print('Silently handle error here')

        # Optionally include a correction to the issue
        a = str(a)
        print(len(a)

    a = '321'
    try:
        print(len(a))
    except:
        print('Silently handle error here')

        # Optionally include a correction to the issue
        a = str(a)
        print(len(a))

-   <span id="dcd1">You can name an error to give the output more specificity.</span>

<!-- -->

    a = 100
    b = 0
    try:
        c = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        c = None
    print(c)

-   <span id="4027">You can also use the `pass` commmand to by pass a certain error.</span>

<!-- -->

    a = 100
    b = 0
    try:
        print(a / b)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass

-   <span id="030b">The `pass` method won't allow you to bypass every single error so you can chain an exception series like so:</span>

<!-- -->

    a = 100
    # b = "5"
    try:
        print(a / b)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass
    except (TypeError, NameError):
        print("ERROR!")

-   <span id="bf45">You can use an `else` statement to end a chain of `except` statements.</span>

<!-- -->

    # tuple of file names
    files = ('one.txt', 'two.txt', 'three.txt')

    # simple loop
    for filename in files:
        try:
            # open the file in read mode
            f = open(filename, 'r')
        except OSError:
            # handle the case where file does not exist or permission is denied
            print('cannot open file', filename)
        else:
            # do stuff with the file object (f)
            print(filename, 'opened successfully')
            print('found', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')
            f.close()

-   <span id="0e91">`finally` is used at the end to clean up all actions under any circumstance.</span>

<!-- -->

    def divide(x, y):
        try:
            result = x / y
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Cannot divide by zero")
        else:
            print("Result is", result)
        finally:
            print("Finally...")

-   <span id="84ee">Using duck typing to check to see if some value is able to use a certain method.</span>

<!-- -->

    # Try a number - nothing will print out
    a = 321
    if hasattr(a, '__len__'):
        print(len(a))

    # Try a string - the length will print out (4 in this case)
    b = "5555"
    if hasattr(b, '__len__'):
        print(len(b))

---

### Pass

-   <span id="2b80">Pass Keyword is required to write the JS equivalent of¬†:</span>

<!-- -->

    if (true) {
    }

    while (true) {}

    if True:
      pass

    while True:
      pass

---

### Functions

-   <span id="7091">**Function definition includes:**</span>
-   <span id="1f11">**The** `def` **keyword**</span>
-   <span id="ec14">**The name of the function**</span>
-   <span id="7733">**A list of parameters enclosed in parentheses.**</span>
-   <span id="1516">**A colon at the end of the line.**</span>
-   <span id="b2dd">**One tab indentation for the code to run.**</span>
-   <span id="bcef">**You can use default parameters just like in JS**</span>

<!-- -->

    def greeting(name, saying="Hello"):
        print(saying, name)

    greeting("Monica")
    # Hello Monica

    greeting("Barry", "Hey")
    # Hey Barry

#### **Keep in mind, default parameters must always come after regular parameters.**

    # THIS IS BAD CODE AND WILL NOT RUN
    def increment(delta=1, value):
        return delta + value

-   <span id="c1aa">_You can specify arguments by name without destructuring in Python._</span>

<!-- -->

    def greeting(name, saying="Hello"):
        print(saying, name)

    # name has no default value, so just provide the value
    # saying has a default value, so use a keyword argument
    greeting("Monica", saying="Hi")

-   <span id="54ac">The `lambda` keyword is used to create anonymous functions and are supposed to be `one-liners`.</span>

`toUpper = lambda s: s.upper()`

---

### Notes

#### Formatted Strings

> Remember that in Python join() is called on a string with an array/list passed in as the argument.  
> Python has a very powerful formatting engine.  
> format() is also applied directly to strings.

    shopping_list = [‚Äòbread‚Äô,‚Äômilk‚Äô,‚Äôeggs‚Äô]
    print(‚Äò,‚Äô.join(shopping_list))

### Comma Thousands Separator

    print(‚Äò{:,}‚Äô.format(1234567890))
    ‚Äò1,234,567,890‚Äô

### Date and¬†Time

    d = datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 4, 12, 15, 58)
    print(‚Äò{:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}‚Äô.format(d))
    ‚Äò2020‚Äì07‚Äì04 12:15:58‚Äô

### Percentage

    points = 190
    total = 220
    print(‚ÄòCorrect answers: {:.2%}‚Äô.format(points/total))
    Correct answers: 86.36%

### Data Tables

    width=8
    print(‚Äò decimal hex binary‚Äô)
    print(‚Äò-‚Äô*27)
    for num in range(1,16):
    for base in ‚ÄòdXb‚Äô:
    print(‚Äò{0:{width}{base}}‚Äô.format(num, base=base, width=width), end=‚Äô ‚Äò)
    print()
    Getting Input from the Command Line
    Python runs synchronously, all programs and processes will stop when listening for a user input.
    The input function shows a prompt to a user and waits for them to type ‚ÄòENTER‚Äô.
    Scripts vs Programs
    Programming Script : A set of code that runs in a linear fashion.
    The largest difference between scripts and programs is the level of complexity and purpose. Programs typically have many UI‚Äôs.

**Python can be used to display html, css, and JS.**  
_It is common to use Python as an API (Application Programming Interface)_

#### Structured Data

#### Sequence¬†: The most basic data structure in Python where the index determines the¬†order.

> List  
> Tuple  
> Range  
> Collections¬†: Unordered data structures, hashable values.

---

#### Dictionaries Sets

#### Iterable¬†: Generic name for a sequence or collection; any object that can be iterated¬†through.

#### Can be mutable or immutable. Built In Data¬†Types

---

### Lists are the python equivalent of¬†arrays.

    empty_list = []
    departments = [‚ÄòHR‚Äô,‚ÄôDevelopment‚Äô,‚ÄôSales‚Äô,‚ÄôFinance‚Äô,‚ÄôIT‚Äô,‚ÄôCustomer Support‚Äô]

### You can instantiate

    specials = list()

#### Test if a value is in a¬†list.

    print(1 in [1, 2, 3]) #> True
    print(4 in [1, 2, 3]) #> False
    # Tuples : Very similar to lists, but they are immutable

#### Instantiated with parentheses

    time_blocks = (‚ÄòAM‚Äô,‚ÄôPM‚Äô)

#### Sometimes instantiated without

    colors = ‚Äòred‚Äô,‚Äôblue‚Äô,‚Äôgreen‚Äô
    numbers = 1, 2, 3

#### Tuple() built in can be used to convert other data into a¬†tuple

    tuple(‚Äòabc‚Äô) # returns (‚Äòa‚Äô, ‚Äòb‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äô)
    tuple([1,2,3]) # returns (1, 2, 3)
    # Think of tuples as constant variables.

#### Ranges¬†: A list of numbers which can‚Äôt be changed; often used with for¬†loops.

**Declared using one to three parameters**.

> Start¬†: opt. default 0, first \# in sequence.  
> Stop¬†: required next number past the last number in the sequence.  
> Step¬†: opt. default 1, difference between each number in the sequence.

    range(5) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    range(1,5) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    range(0, 25, 5) # [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]
    range(0) # [ ]
    for let (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    for let (i = 1; i < 5; i++)
    for let (i = 0; i < 25; i+=5)
    for let(i = 0; i = 0; i++)
    # Keep in mind that stop is not included in the range.

#### Dictionaries¬†: Mappable collection where a hashable value is used as a key to ref. an object stored in the dictionary.

#### Mutable.

    a = {‚Äòone‚Äô:1, ‚Äòtwo‚Äô:2, ‚Äòthree‚Äô:3}
    b = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
    c = dict([(‚Äòtwo‚Äô, 2), (‚Äòone‚Äô, 1), (‚Äòthree‚Äô, 3)])
    # a, b, and c are all equal

**_Declared with curly braces of the built in dict()_**

> _Benefit of dictionaries in Python is that it doesn‚Äôt matter how it is defined, if the keys and values are the same the dictionaries are considered equal._

**Use the in operator to see if a key exists in a dictionary.**

<span class="graf-dropCap">S</span>**ets¬†: Unordered collection of distinct objects; objects that need to be hashable.**

> _Always be unique, duplicate items are auto dropped from the set._

#### Common Uses:

> Removing Duplicates  
> Membership Testing  
> Mathematical Operators: Intersection, Union, Difference, Symmetric Difference.

**Standard Set is mutable, Python has a immutable version called frozenset.  
Sets created by putting comma seperated values inside braces:**

    school_bag = {‚Äòbook‚Äô,‚Äôpaper‚Äô,‚Äôpencil‚Äô,‚Äôpencil‚Äô,‚Äôbook‚Äô,‚Äôbook‚Äô,‚Äôbook‚Äô,‚Äôeraser‚Äô}
    print(school_bag)

#### Also can use set constructor to automatically put it into a¬†set.

    letters = set(‚Äòabracadabra‚Äô)
    print(letters)
    #Built-In Functions
    #Functions using iterables

**filter(function, iterable)¬†: creates new iterable of the same type which includes each item for which the function returns true.**

**map(function, iterable)¬†: creates new iterable of the same type which includes the result of calling the function on every item of the iterable.**

**sorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False)¬†: creates a new sorted list from the items in the iterable.**

**Output is always a list**

**key: opt function which coverts and item to a value to be compared.**

**reverse: optional boolean.**

**enumerate(iterable, start=0)¬†: starts with a sequence and converts it to a series of tuples**

    quarters = [‚ÄòFirst‚Äô, ‚ÄòSecond‚Äô, ‚ÄòThird‚Äô, ‚ÄòFourth‚Äô]
    print(enumerate(quarters))
    print(enumerate(quarters, start=1))

#### (0, ‚ÄòFirst‚Äô), (1, ‚ÄòSecond‚Äô), (2, ‚ÄòThird‚Äô), (3, ‚ÄòFourth‚Äô)

#### (1, ‚ÄòFirst‚Äô), (2, ‚ÄòSecond‚Äô), (3, ‚ÄòThird‚Äô), (4, ‚ÄòFourth‚Äô)

> zip(\*iterables)¬†: creates a zip object filled with tuples that combine 1 to 1 the items in each provided iterable.  
> Functions that analyze iterable

**len(iterable)¬†: returns the count of the number of items.**

**max(\*args, key=None)¬†: returns the largest of two or more arguments.**

**max(iterable, key=None)¬†: returns the largest item in the iterable.**

_key optional function which converts an item to a value to be compared.  
min works the same way as max_

**sum(iterable)¬†: used with a list of numbers to generate the total.**

_There is a faster way to concatenate an array of strings into one string, so do not use sum for that._

**any(iterable)¬†: returns True if any items in the iterable are true.**

**all(iterable)¬†: returns True is all items in the iterable are true.**

### Working with dictionaries

**dir(dictionary)¬†: returns the list of keys in the dictionary.  
Working with sets**

**Union¬†: The pipe | operator or union(\*sets) function can be used to produce a new set which is a combination of all elements in the provided set.**

    a = {1, 2, 3}
    b = {2, 4, 6}
    print(a | b) # => {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}

#### Intersection¬†: The & operator ca be used to produce a new set of only the elements that appear in all¬†sets.

    a = {1, 2, 3}
    b = {2, 4, 6}
    print(a & b) # => {2}
    Difference : The ‚Äî operator can be used to produce a new set of only the elements that appear in the first set and NOT the others.

**Symmetric Difference¬†: The ^ operator can be used to produce a new set of only the elements that appear in exactly one set and not in both.**

    a = {1, 2, 3}
    b = {2, 4, 6}
    print(a ‚Äî b) # => {1, 3}
    print(b ‚Äî a) # => {4, 6}
    print(a ^ b) # => {1, 3, 4, 6}

---

### **For Statements In python, there is only one for¬†loop.**

Always Includes:

> 1. The for keyword
> 2. A variable name
> 3. The ‚Äòin‚Äô keyword
> 4. An iterable of some kid
> 5. A colon
> 6. On the next line, an indented block of code called the for clause.

**You can use break and continue statements inside for loops as well.**

**You can use the range function as the iterable for the for loop.**

    print(‚ÄòMy name is‚Äô)
    for i in range(5):
    print(‚ÄòCarlita Cinco (‚Äò + str(i) + ‚Äò)‚Äô)

    total = 0
    for num in range(101):
    total += num
    print(total)
    Looping over a list in Python
    for c in [‚Äòa‚Äô, ‚Äòb‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äô]:
    print(c)

    lst = [0, 1, 2, 3]
    for i in lst:
    print(i)

**_Common technique is to use the len() on a pre-defined list with a for loop to iterate over the indices of the list._**

    supplies = [‚Äòpens‚Äô, ‚Äòstaplers‚Äô, ‚Äòflame-throwers‚Äô, ‚Äòbinders‚Äô]
    for i in range(len(supplies)):
    print(‚ÄòIndex ‚Äò + str(i) + ‚Äò in supplies is: ‚Äò + supplies[i])

**You can loop and destructure at the same time.**

    l = 1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6
    for a, b in l:
    print(a, ‚Äò, ‚Äò, b)

> Prints 1, 2

> Prints 3, 4

> Prints 5, 6

**You can use values() and keys() to loop over dictionaries.**

    spam = {‚Äòcolor‚Äô: ‚Äòred‚Äô, ‚Äòage‚Äô: 42}
    for v in spam.values():
    print(v)

_Prints red_

_Prints 42_

    for k in spam.keys():
    print(k)

_Prints color_

_Prints age_

**For loops can also iterate over both keys and values.**

**Getting tuples**

    for i in spam.items():
    print(i)

_Prints (‚Äòcolor‚Äô, ‚Äòred‚Äô)_

_Prints (‚Äòage‚Äô, 42)_

_Destructuring to values_

    for k, v in spam.items():
    print(‚ÄòKey: ‚Äò + k + ‚Äò Value: ‚Äò + str(v))

_Prints Key: age Value: 42_

_Prints Key: color Value: red_

**Looping over string**

    for c in ‚Äúabcdefg‚Äù:
    print(c)

**When you order arguments within a function or function call, the args need to occur in a particular order:**

_formal positional args._

\*args

_keyword args with default values_

\*\*kwargs

    def example(arg_1, arg_2, *args, **kwargs):
    pass

    def example2(arg_1, arg_2, *args, kw_1=‚Äùshark‚Äù, kw_2=‚Äùblowfish‚Äù, **kwargs):
    pass

### **Importing in¬†Python**

**Modules are similar to packages in Node.js**  
Come in different types:

Built-In,

Third-Party,

Custom.

**All loaded using import statements.**

---

### **Terms**

> module¬†: Python code in a separate file.  
> package¬†: Path to a directory that contains modules.  
> <a href="http://init.py" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor"><strong>init.py</strong></a>¬†: Default file for a package.  
> submodule¬†: Another file in a module‚Äôs folder.  
> function¬†: Function in a module.

**A module can be any file but it is usually created by placing a special file init.py into a folder. pic**

_Try to avoid importing with wildcards in Python._

_Use multiple lines for clarity when importing._

    from urllib.request import (
    HTTPDefaultErrorHandler as ErrorHandler,
    HTTPRedirectHandler as RedirectHandler,
    Request,
    pathname2url,
    url2pathname,
    urlopen,
    )

---

### Watching Out for Python¬†2

**Python 3 removed &lt;&gt; and only uses¬†!=**

**format() was introduced with P3**

**All strings in P3 are unicode and encoded.  
md5 was removed.**

**ConfigParser was renamed to configparser  
sets were killed in favor of set() class.**

#### **print was a statement in P2, but is a function in¬†P3.**

#### Understanding variables <a id="understanding-variables"></a>

Variables are simply declarations that are used to store certain values. For instance, the variable `name` can hold the value of `John Smith.` Several rules need to be considered when declaring variable names. For starters, a variable name cannot begin with a number.

`2name = incorrect #incorrect`

`name = correct #correct`

Variable names are case sensitive. This means that the variable `school` is not the same as `School`.

Variables can hold different data types. This includes strings, integers, Booleans, long, lists, and arrays.

In Python, we do not need to declare the data type while writing a variable. This is because the code is compiled and interpreted later. The compiler will throw an error in case there is a mismatch in the data types.

Let‚Äôs talk about the different data types.

1. Strings

Strings are usually presented in a text format. We will declare a string variable, as shown below.

```python
name = ‚Äújohn‚Äùschool = ‚ÄúAlliance Francaise‚Äù
```

When we run `print(name)`, the output will be `john`.

1. Integers

These variables hold numeric values, as shown below.

```python
math = 90chemistry = 100biology = 70
```

We can find the total of the variables above using the following statement.

```python
print(math+chemistry+biology)
```

The total is `260`.

A TypeError is thrown when you try to add a string to an integer, as shwon below.

```python
var1 = "30" #stringvar2 = 20 #integer‚Äãprint(var1+var2)#type error
```

We can sum `var1` and `var2` by converting `var1` to an integer using the `int()` function. The following code will execute successfully.

```python
var1 = "30" #stringvar2 = 20 #integer‚Äãprint(int(var1)+var2) # Output: 50
```

> Make sure that the variable stores a value that can be converted to an integer before using the int\(\) method.

1. Booleans

There are only two Boolean values: `True` and `False`. In other words, something can either be true or false. We declare these values, as shown below. Please note that Python is case sensitive.

```python
isOn = TrueisChecked = False
```

A `bool()` method can help convert a value to a boolean. The code snippets below showcase how a `bool()` function can be used.

```python
print(bool("abc")) #returns Trueprint(bool(0))  #returns False
```

The `bool()` function returns False when there are no parameters.

1. Float

This data type consists of numbers that have a decimal place. A perfect example of a float variable is highlighted below.

```python
Bmi = 45.7
```

#### Understanding lists <a id="understanding-lists"></a>

Lists allow us to store numerous elements in a particular variable. For instance, we can have a list that stores all the student names in a class. We use `[]` to define a list.

```python
students = [] #list example
```

Elements in a list are usually separated by a comma, as shown below.

```python
students = [‚Äújohn‚Äù, ‚ÄúMary Thomas‚Äù, ‚ÄúJohn Smith‚Äù]
```

Each element in the above `students` list has an index. By default, the first index is 0. So the item at index \[0\] is `john`, while the value at index `1` is `Mary Thomas`. A list of integers will look as follows.

```python
student_marks = [90, 78, 90, 78]
```

We can access different list functionalities using built-in functions. For instance, to add a value to the `student_marks` list, we use the `append` function.

```python
student_marks.append("Guardian Angel")print(student_marks)
```

The above function adds `Guardian Angel` at the end of the `student_marks` list.

When we print the list it shows:

```python
#output[90, 78, 90, 78, 'Guardian Angel']
```

We use `len(student_marks)` to determine the length of the list. We use the `remove()` function to delete something from the list. For instance, we can remove `90` from the `student_mark` list as shown below.

```python
student_marks.remove(90)print(student_marks)
```

In lists, negative indices allow us to count elements starting from the last one. For instance, the element with an index of `-1` in the above `student_marks` list is `"Guardian Angel"`. The second last element `78` has an index of `-2`.

#### Understanding functions or methods <a id="understanding-functions-or-methods"></a>

Methods are quite critical in programming. They help store reusable code. This means that a person can call already declared methods rather than writing statements from scratch repeatedly. This saves significant time, that can be invested in other productive activities.

In Python, we use the `def` keyword to declare a function. An example of a python method is shown below.

```python
def readData():    print('success')
```

The above function prints `success` when it‚Äôs invoked. We can also pass data to a method, perform some calculations, and return the results. This is demonstrated in the code snippet below.

```python
def calculateTotal(chem, bio):    return chem+bio‚Äãprint(calculateTotal(90,80))
```

The `calculateTotal` method takes in two parameters \(chem, bio\). The function then returns the sum of the two values. It is important to take note of the data types when passing parameters. For instance, the `calculateTotal` method will not work when we pass in a string as a parameter. This is because the program cannot sum up an integer and a string. As shown above, we can call the `calculateTotal` method directly from our print statement.

```python
print(calculateTotal(90,80))
```

The `return` keyword ensures that the method returns a result after execution.

> Note that a function can also call another method. This is illustrated below.

```python
def readData(chem, bio):    return chem+bio‚Äãdef getTotal():    print(readData(90,80)) #calls the readData method‚ÄãgetTotal()
```

#### Understanding loops <a id="understanding-loops"></a>

Loops are critical because they allow us to iterate through lists, check for different conditions, and continuously execute various statements. The main loops are `for` and `while`.

1. For loops As noted, we can use a for loop to iterate through a list, as shown below:

```python
student_list = [‚ÄúJohn Doore‚Äù,‚ÄùMatu Smith‚Äù]for x in student_list:    print(x)
```

The `for` loop above will print every item in the student\_list.

1. While loops A while loop can help us check for a particular condition. For instance, while something is true specific statements can be executed. Here is an example of a while loop in action.

```python
isChecked = falsewhile isChecked == true:    print('Hallo there')
```

> Note that the while loop above will be executed indefinitely until isChecked is set to false. You can press ctrl+c to stop the loop.

#### Classes <a id="classes"></a>

Classes are a vital component of object-oriented programming. When creating a class, you must use the `class` keyword. Other elements are then nested in the class. Here is an example of a Python class.

```python
class Farmer: # a class with the name farmer    name = "John" # A variable    produce = "1000kgs" # A variable‚Äãfarmer = Farmer() #instatiating the class as an object. print(farmer.name) # accessing the properties of the Farmer class.
```

Classes can help as group things with similar characteristics. We can also assign values to class variables using the `init` function.

```python
class Farmer:  def __init__(self, farmername, produce):    self.farmername = farmername    self.produce = produce‚Äãfarmer = Farmer("Carry Sminson", "10,000kgs")‚Äãprint(farmer.farmername, farmer.produce)
```

In the above `Farmer` class, the `self` keyword represents an instance of an object. In other words, it allows us to access the different methods and attributes defined in the class.

You can also declare a method in a class and use it later, as shown below.

```python
class Farmer:  def __init__(self, farmername, produce):    self.farmername = farmername    self.produce = produce‚Äã  def printDetails(self): # Method      print(self.farmername, self.produce)‚Äãfarmer = Farmer("Carry Sminson", "10,000kgs")‚Äãfarmer.printDetails()
```

## Python syntax was made for readability, and easy editing. For example, the python language uses a `:` and indented code, while javascript and others generally use `{}` and indented code. <a id="python-syntax-was-made-for-readability-and-easy-editing-for-example-the-python-language-uses-a-and-indented-code-while-javascript-and-others-generally-use-and-indented-code"></a>

Lets create a [python 3](https://repl.it/languages/python3) repl, and call it _Hello World_. Now you have a blank file called _main.py_. Now let us write our first line of code:

_helloworld.py_

```python
print('Hello world!')
```

> Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards.

Now, press the run button, which obviously runs the code. If you are not using replit, this will not work. You should research how to run a file with your text editor.

If you look to your left at the console where hello world was just printed, you can see a `>`, `>>>`, or `$` depending on what you are using. After the prompt, try typing a line of code.

```python
Python 3.6.1 (default, Jun 21 2017, 18:48:35)[GCC 4.9.2] on linuxType "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.> print('Testing command line')Testing command line> print('Are you sure this works?')Are you sure this works?>
```

The command line allows you to execute single lines of code at a time. It is often used when trying out a new function or method in the language.

Another cool thing that you can generally do with all languages, are comments. In python, a comment starts with a `#`. The computer ignores all text starting after the `#`.

_shortcom.py_

```python
# Write some comments!
```

If you have a huge comment, do **not** comment all the 350 lines, just put `'''` before it, and `'''` at the end. Technically, this is not a comment but a string, but the computer still ignores it, so we will use it.

_longcom.py_

```python
'''Dear PYer,I am confused about how you said you could use triple quotes to makeSUPERLONGCOMMENTS!‚ÄãI am wondering if this is true,and if so,I am wondering if this is correct.‚ÄãCould you help me with this?‚ÄãThanks,Random guy who used your tutorial.'''print('Testing')
```

Unlike many other languages, there is no `var`, `let`, or `const` to declare a variable in python. You simply go `name = 'value'`.

_vars1.py_

```python
x = 5y = 7z = x*y # 35print(z) # => 35
```

Remember, there is a difference between integers and strings. _Remember: String =_ _`""`._ To convert between these two, you can put an int in a `str()` function, and a string in a `int()` function. There is also a less used one, called a float. Mainly, these are integers with decimals. Change them using the `float()` command.

_vars2.py_

```python
x = 5x = str(x)b = '5'b = int(b)print('x = ', x, '; b = ', str(b), ';') # => x = 5; b = 5;
```

Instead of using the `,` in the print function, you can put a `+` to combine the variables and string.

There are many operators in python:

* `+`
* `-`
* `/`
* `*` These operators are the same in most languages, and allow for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplicaiton. Now, we can look at a few more complicated ones:
* `%`
* `//`
* `**`
* `+=`
* `-=`
* `/=`
* `*=` Research these if you want to find out more‚Ä¶

_simpleops.py_

```python
x = 4a = x + 1a = x - 1a = x * 2a = x / 2
```

You should already know everything shown above, as it is similar to other languages. If you continue down, you will see more complicated ones.

_complexop.py_

```python
a += 1a -= 1a *= 2a /= 2
```

The ones above are to edit the current value of the variable. Sorry to JS users, as there is no `i++;` or anything.

> Fun Fact: The python language was named after Monty Python.

If you really want to know about the others, view [Py Operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm)‚Äã

Like the title? Anyways, a `'` and a `"` both indicate a string, but **do not combine them!**

_quotes.py_

```python
x = 'hello' # Goodx = "hello" # Goodx = "hello' # ERRORRR!!!
```

_slicing.py_

#### String Slicing <a id="string-slicing"></a>

You can look at only certain parts of the string by slicing it, using `[num:num]`. The first number stands for how far in you go from the front, and the second stands for how far in you go from the back.

```python
x = 'Hello everybody!'x[1] # 'e'x[-1] # '!'x[5] # ' 'x[1:] # 'ello everybody!'x[:-1] # 'Hello everybod'x[2:-3] # 'llo everyb'
```

#### Methods and Functions <a id="methods-and-functions"></a>

Here is a list of functions/methods we will go over:

* `.strip()`
* `len()`
* `.lower()`
* `.upper()`
* `.replace()`
* `.split()`

I will make you try these out yourself. See if you can figure out how they work.

_strings.py_

```python
x = " Testing, testing, testing, testing       "print(x.strip())print(len(x))print(x.lower())print(x.upper())print(x.replace('test', 'runn'))print(x.split(','))
```

Good luck, see you when you come back!

Input is a function that gathers input entered from the user in the command line. It takes one optional parameter, which is the users prompt.

_inp.py_

```python
print('Type something: ')x = input()print('Here is what you said: ', x)
```

If you wanted to make it smaller, and look neater to the user, you could do‚Ä¶

_inp2.py_

```python
print('Here is what you said: ', input('Type something: '))
```

Running: _inp.py_

```python
Type something:Hello WorldHere is what you said: Hello World
```

_inp2.py_

```python
Type something: Hello WorldHere is what you said: Hello World
```

Python has created a lot of functions that are located in other .py files. You need to import these **modules** to gain access to the,, You may wonder why python did this. The purpose of separate modules is to make python faster. Instead of storing millions and millions of functions, , it only needs a few basic ones. To import a module, you must write `input <modulename>`. Do not add the .py extension to the file name. In this example , we will be using a python created module named random.

_module.py_

```python
import random
```

Now, I have access to all functions in the random.py file. To access a specific function in the module, you would do `<module>.<function>`. For example:

_module2.py_

```python
import randomprint(random.randint(3,5)) # Prints a random number between 3 and 5
```

> Pro Tip: Do `from random import randint` to not have to do `random.randint()`, just `randint()` To import all functions from a module, you could do `from random import *`

Loops allow you to repeat code over and over again. This is useful if you want to print Hi with a delay of one second 100 times.

**for Loop**

The for loop goes through a list of variables, making a seperate variable equal one of the list every time. Let‚Äôs say we wanted to create the example above.

_loop.py_

```python
from time import sleepfor i in range(100):     print('Hello')     sleep(.3)
```

This will print Hello with a .3 second delay 100 times. This is just one way to use it, but it is usually used like this:

_loop2.py_

```python
import timefor number in range(100):     print(number)     time.sleep(.1)
```

**while Loop**

The while loop runs the code while something stays true. You would put `while <expression>`. Every time the loop runs, it evaluates if the expression is True. It it is, it runs the code, if not it continues outside of the loop. For example:

_while.py_

```python
while True: # Runs forever     print('Hello World!')
```

Or you could do:

_while2.py_

```python
import randomposition = '<placeholder>'while position != 1: # will run at least once    position = random.randint(1, 10)    print(position)
```

The if statement allows you to check if something is True. If so, it runs the code, if not, it continues on. It is kind of like a while loop, but it executes **only once**. An if statement is written:

_if.py_

```python
import randomnum = random.randint(1, 10)if num == 3:     print('num is 3. Hooray!!!')if num > 5:     print('Num is greater than 5')if num == 12:     print('Num is 12, which means that there is a problem with the python language, see if you can figure it out. Extra credit if you can figure it out!')
```

Now, you may think that it would be better if you could make it print only one message. Not as many that are True. You can do that with an `elif` statement:

_elif.py_

```python
import randomnum = random.randint(1, 10)if num == 3:    print('Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.')elif num > 2:    print('Num is not three, but is greater than 1')
```

Now, you may wonder how to run code if none work. Well, there is a simple statement called `else:`

_else.py_

```python
import randomnum = random.randint(1, 10)if num == 3:    print('Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.')elif num > 2:    print('Num is not three, but is greater than 1')else:    print('No category')
```

So far, you have only seen how to use functions other people have made. Let use the example that you want to print the a random number between 1 and 9, and print different text every time. It is quite tiring to type:

Characters: 389

_nofunc.py_

```python
import randomprint(random.randint(1, 9))print('Wow that was interesting.')print(random.randint(1, 9))print('Look at the number above ^')print(random.randint(1, 9))print('All of these have been interesting numbers.')print(random.randint(1, 9))print("these random.randint's are getting annoying to type")print(random.randint(1, 9))print('Hi')print(random.randint(1, 9))print('j')
```

Now with functions, you can seriously lower the amount of characters:

Characters: 254

_functions.py_

```python
import randomdef r(t):     print(random.randint(1, 9))     print(t)r('Wow that was interesting.')r('Look at the number above ^')r('All of these have been interesting numbers.')r("these random.randint's are getting annoying to type")r('Hi')r('j')
```

#### Installing Python 3, And Launching Python Shell <a id="installing-python-3-and-launching-python-shell"></a>

This video should help you get up and running with Python 3

* ‚Äã[Installing Python 3 and Launch Python Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji1WW4Suaww)‚Äã

Installing Python is really a cakewalk. Search for ‚ÄúPython download‚Äù on [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/). Download the installable and install it.

A quick word of caution on Windows

* Make sure that you have the check-box ‚ÄúAdd Python 3.6 to PATH‚Äù, checked.

Once you have installed Python, you can launch the Python Shell.

* Windows - Launch cmd prompt by typing in ‚Äòcmd‚Äô command.
* Mac or Linux - Launch up terminal.

Command to launch Python 3 is different in Mac.

* In Mac, type in `python3`
* In other operating systems, including windows, type `python`

You can type code in python shell and code as well!

You can use `print(5*4)`, and it shows `20`.

You can execute the code, and the shell would immediately give you output.

Using the the Python Shell is an awesome way to learn Python.

### Chapter 02 - Introduction To Python Programming <a id="chapter-02-introduction-to-python-programming"></a>

Most programmers find programming a lot of fun, and besides, it also gets their work done.

Programming mainly involves _problem solving_, where one makes use of a computer to solve a real world problem.

During our journey here, we will approach programming in a very different way. We will not only introduce you to the Python language, but also help you pick up essential problem solving skills.

As a programmer, you need to be able to look at a problem, and identify the important programming concepts relevant to solving it. Finally, you need to be able to use the language features and syntax, to express your solution on the computer. While all this looks complex, we want to make it easy for you. Together, we will tackle a variety of programming challenges, using these same steps. We will start with simple challenges \(such as a Multiplication Table\), and gradually increase the difficulty level over the duration of this book.

Learning to program is a lot like learning to ride a bicycle. The first few steps are the most challenging ones.

Once you get over these initial steps, your experience will become more and more enjoyable.

Are you ready for your first programming challenge? Let‚Äôs get going now! We wish you all the best.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Were introduced to the concept of problem solving
* Understood how good programmers approach problem solving

#### Step 01: Our First Programming Challenge <a id="step-01-our-first-programming-challenge"></a>

Our first _programming challenge_ aims to do, what every kid does in math class: read out a multiplication table. We now want to give this task to the computer. Here is the statement of our problem:

**The Print Multiplication Table Challenge \(PMT-Challenge\)**

1. Compute the multiplication table for `5`, with entries from `1` to `10`.
2. Display this table.

The display needs to be:

_**5 \* 1 = 5**_

_**5 \* 2 = 10**_

_**5 \* 3 = 15**_

_**5 \* 4 = 20**_

_**5 \* 5 = 25**_

_**5 \* 6 = 30**_

_**5 \* 7 = 35**_

_**5 \* 8 = 40**_

_**5 \* 9 = 45**_

_**5 \* 10 = 50**_

This is the challenge. For convenience, let‚Äôs give it a label, say _PMT-Challenge_. What would be the important concepts we need to learn, to solve this challenge? The following list of concepts would be a good starting point:

* **Statements**
* **Expressions**
* **Variables**
* **Literals**
* **Conditionals**
* **Loops**
* **Methods**

In the rest of this chapter, we will introduce these concepts to you, one-by-one. We will also show you how learning each concept, takes us closer to a solution to _PMT-Challenge_.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Stated our first programming challenge
* Identified what programming concepts we need to learn, to solve this challenge

#### Step 02: Breaking Down _PMT-Challenge_ <a id="step-02-breaking-down-pmt-challenge"></a>

Typically when we do programming, we have problems. Solving the problem typically need a step-by -step approach. Common sense tells us that to solve a complex problem, we break it into smaller parts, and solve each part one by one. Here is how any good programmer worth her salt, would solve a problem:

* Simplify the problem, by breaking it into sub-problems
* Solve the sub-problems in stages \(in some order\), using the language
* Combine these solutions to get a final solution

The _PMT-Challenge_ is no different! Now how do we break it down, and where do we really start? Once again, your common sense will reveal a solution. As a first step, we could get the computer to calculate say, `5 * 3`. The second thing we can do, is to try and print the calculated value, in a manner similar to `5 * 3 = 15`. Then, we could repeat what we just did, to print out all the entries of the `5` multiplication table. Let‚Äôs put it down a little more formally:

Here is how our draft steps look like

* Calculate `5 * 3` and print result as `15`
* Print `5 * 3 = 15` \(`15` is result of previous calculation\)
* Do this ten times, once for each table entry \(going from `1` to `10`\)

Let‚Äôs start with that kind of a game plan, and see where it takes us.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Learned that breaking down a problem into sub-problems is a great help
* Found a way to break down the _PMT-Challenge_ problem

#### Step 03: Introducing Operators And Expressions <a id="step-03-introducing-operators-and-expressions"></a>

Let‚Äôs focus on solving the first sub-problem of _PMT-Challenge_, the numeric computation. We want the computer to calculate `5 * 5` for example, and print `25` for us. How do we get it to do that? That‚Äôs what we would be looking at in this step.

**Snippet-01: Introducing Operators**

Launch up Python shell. We want to calculate `5 * 5`. How do we do that?

Using our knowledge of school math, let‚Äôs try `5 X 5`.

```python
    >>> 5 X 5    File "< stdin >", line 1    5 X 5      ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

The Python Shell hits back at us, saying ‚Äú_invalid syntax_‚Äù. This is how Python complains, when it doesn‚Äôt fully understand the code you type in. Here, it says our code has a ‚Äú**SyntaxError**‚Äù.

The reason why it complains, is because ‚Äò`X`‚Äô is not a valid **operator** in Python.

The way you can do multiplication is by using the ‚Äò`*`‚Äô _operator_ .

‚Äú_5 into 5_‚Äù is achieved by the code `5 * 5`, and you can see the result `25` being printed. Similarly, `5 * 6` gives us `30`.

```python
    >>> 5 * 6    30
```

There are a wide range of other operators in Python:

* `5 + 6` gives a result of `11`.
* `5 - 6` leads to `-1`.

  ```python
  >>> 5 + 611>>> 5 - 6-1
  ```

`10 / 2`, gives an output of `5.0` . There is one interesting operator, `**`. Let‚Äôs try `10 ** 3`. We ran this code, and the result we get is `1000`. Yes you guessed right, the operator performs ‚Äúto the power of‚Äù. ‚Äú`10` to the power of `3`‚Äù is `10 * 10 * 10`, or `1000`.

```python
    >>> 10 / 2    5.0    >>> 10 ** 3    1000
```

Another interesting operator is `%`, called ‚Äú_modulo_‚Äù, which computes the remainder on integer division. If we do `10 % 3`, what is the remainder when `10` is divided by `3`? `3 * 3` is `9`, and `10 - 9` is `1`, which is what `%` returns in this case.

Let‚Äôs look at some terminology:

* Whatever pieces of code we gave Python shell to run, are called **expressions**. So, `5 * 5`, `5 * 6` and `5 - 6` are all _expressions_. An expression is composed of _operators_ and **operands**.
* In the expression `5 * 6`, the two values `5` and `6` are called operands, and the `*` operator _operates_ on them.
* The values `5` and `6` are **literals**, because those are constants which cannot be changed.

The cool thing about Python, is that you can even have expressions with multiple operators. Therefore, you can form an expression with `5 + 5 + 5`, which evaluates to `15`. This is an expression which has three operands, and two `+` operators. You can even have expressions with different types of operators, such as in `5 + 5 * 5`.

```python
    >>> 5 + 5 + 5    15    >>> 5 + 5 * 5    30
```

Try and play around with the expressions, and understand the output which results.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Learned how to give code input to the Python Shell
* Understood that Python has a predefined set of operators
* Used a few types of basic operators and their operands, to form expressions

#### Step 04: Programming Exercise IN-PE-01 <a id="step-04-programming-exercise-in-pe-01"></a>

At this stage, your smile tells us that you enjoy evaluating Python expressions. What if we tickle your mind a bit, to make sure it hasn‚Äôt fallen asleep? Here is your first programming exercise.

**Exercises**

1. Write an expression to calculate the number of minutes in a day.
2. Write an expression to calculate the number of seconds in a day.

**Note**

You need to solve these problems by yourself. If you are able to work them out, that‚Äôs fantastic! But if not, that‚Äôs part of the learning process.

**Solutions**

**Solution 1**

```python
    >>> 24 * 60‚Äã    1440
```

We wanted to calculate the number of minutes in a day. How do we do that? Think about this‚Ä¶

* How many number of hours are there in a day? `24`.
* And how many minutes does each hour have? It‚Äôs `60`.
* So if you want to find out the number of minutes in a day, it‚Äôs `24 * 60`, which is `1440`.

**Solution 2**

```python
    >>> 24 * 60 * 60‚Äã    86400
```

How many seconds are there in a day?

* Let‚Äôs start with the number of hours, `24`.
* The number of minutes in an hour is `60`, and
* The number of seconds in a minute is `60` as well.
* So it‚Äôs `24 * 60 * 60`, or `86400`.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Solved a Programming Exercise involving common scenarios, using Python code involving:
  * Expressions
  * Operators
  * Literals

#### Step 05: Puzzles On Expressions <a id="step-05-puzzles-on-expressions"></a>

Let‚Äôs look at a few puzzles related to expressions, in this step. Before that, let‚Äôs revise some of the terminology we had learned earlier.

`5 + 6 + 10` is an example of an expression. In this expression, `5`, `6` and `10` are operands. The `+` here is the operator. You can have multiple operators in an expression. We also did mention that the operands, namely `10`, `6` and `5`, are literals. Their values will not change.

Here are a few puzzles coming up, to explore aspects of expressions.

**Snippet-01: Puzzles On Expressions**

Think about what would happen when you do something of this kind: `5 $ 2`. You‚Äôre right, it would throw a `SyntaxError`. When Python does not understand the code you type in, it reports an error. Here, the expression we‚Äôre typing is `5 $ 2`, which does not make sense to Python, hence the `SyntaxError`.

```python
    >>> 5 $ 2    File "< stdin >", line 1    5 $ 2    ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax    >>> 5$2    File "< stdin >", line 1    5 $ 2    ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Let‚Äôs say we type in `5+6+10`, without any spaces between the operands, and the operators. What do you think will happen? Surprisingly, the Python Shell does calculate the value!

```python
    >>> 5+6+10    21
```

In an expression, using spaces makes it easier for you to read it, but it‚Äôs not mandatory. `5 + 6 + 10` is easier to read than `5+6+10`, but does not make any difference to the Python compiler.

The next puzzle tries to evaluate `5 / 2`, which is ‚Äú`5` divided by `2`‚Äù. What would be the output? `2.5`.

```python
    >>> 5/2    2.5
```

If you‚Äôre coming from other programming languages like Java or C, this might be a surprising result. If you try this in Java for instance, you would get `2` as the output. Note that even though both operands are integers, the result of the `/` operation is a floating point value, `2.5` . Python does what is expected by a programmer!

The puzzle after that tries to play with `5 + 5 * 6`. What would be the result of this expression? Will it be `5 + 5` or `10`, then `10 * 6`, which is `60`? Or, will it be `5` plus `5 * 6`, which is `5` + `30`, that‚Äôs `35`?

```python
    >>> 5 + 5 * 6    35
```

The correct result is `35`.

Python decides this is based on the **precedence** of operators.

Operators in Python are divided into two sets as follows:

* `**`, `*`, `/` and `%` have higher precedence, or priority.
* `+` and `-` have a lower precedence.

Sub-expressions involving operators from {`*`, `/`, `%`, `**`} are evaluated before those involving operators from {`+`, `-`}

Let‚Äôs try another small puzzle on precedence, with `5 - 2 * 2`. What would be the result of this? Will it be `6`, or `1`? It‚Äôs `1`, because `*` has a higher precedence than `-`. Thus `2 * 2` is `4`, and `5 - 4` gives us `1`.

```python
    >>> 5 - 2 * 2    1
```

Let‚Äôs say we want to execute `5 - 2`, to give an output of `2`. How do we change the operator precedence?

You cannot really change the precedence, but you can add parentheses to group sub-expressions differently.

```python
    >>> (5 - 2) * 2    6    >>> 5 - ( 2 * 2 )    1
```

Parentheses have the highest precedence in Python, and can be used to override operator precedence. `(5 - 2)` gets calculated first, and the final result of the expression is `6`.

A positive thing about using parentheses is, that it makes expressions more readable. So even in situations such as `5 - 2 * 2`, where we know the result according to precedence, adding parentheses is good.

**Summary**

In this step, we went about solving a few puzzles about expressions, touching concepts such as:

* `SyntaxError` for incorrect operators
* White-space in expressions
* Floating Point division by default
* Operator Precedence
* Using parentheses

#### Step 06: Printing Text <a id="step-06-printing-text"></a>

In the previous step, we learned how to use expressions to compute values. In this step, let‚Äôs see how we can actually print multiplication table entries, that are readable by the user.

**Snippet-01: Printing Text**

How do we go about printing a complete multiplication table entry? We want to print text such as `5 * 6 = 30` . But trying to do so, as we know it, gives us a `SyntaxError`. Clearly, there is a different way to print text, as compared to an expression.

```python
    >>> 5 * 6 = 30      File "<stdin>", line 1    SyntaxError: can't assign to operator
```

Let‚Äôs first try to print a simple piece of text, `Hello`. Typing in this piece of code directly on Python Shell also gives us an error.

```python
    >>> Hello    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>    NameError: name 'Hello' is not defined
```

Only expressions work that way, and `Hello` is not really an expression.

`"Hello"` is typically called a **string**, and represents the text of letters `'H'`, `'e'`, `'l'`, `'l'`, `'o'`. `"Hello"` is hence different from the number `5`.

There are a number of in-built functions in Python to help print strings. One of these is the `print()` function. Can you just say `print Hello`?

```python
    >>> print Hello      File "<stdin>", line 1        print Hello                  ^    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(Hello)?
```

The Python compiler gives you an error, that says ‚Äúmissing parentheses‚Äù.

Will `print(Hello)` work?

```python
    >>> print (Hello)    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>    NameError: name 'Hello' is not defined
```

Nope! Again, this one failed because you need to indicate that `"Hello"` is a string.

How do I indicate that `"Hello"` is a string? By putting it within double quotes.

Let‚Äôs try `print ("Hello")`

```python
    >>> print ("Hello")    Hello    >>> print("Hello")    Hello
```

`print("Hello")` finally results in `"Hello"` being printed out. To be able to print `"Hello"`, the things we need to do are:

* Typing the method name print ,
* open parentheses \( ,
* Followed by a double quote " ,
* The text Hello,
* and another double quote " ,
* finished off with a closed parentheses \).

What we have written here is called a **statement**, a simple piece of code to execute. As part of this statement, we are **calling** a **function**, named `print()`.

What exactly are we trying to print?

The text `"Hello"`, which is called a **parameter** or **argument**, to `print()`.

Now let‚Äôs get back to what we wanted to do, which is to print `5 * 6 = 30`. The most basic version would be something of this kind, `print("5 * 6 = 30")`. Here, we are passing the entire value in the form of a string.

```python
    >>> print("5 * 6 = 30")    5 * 6 = 30
```

This prints the text on the console, as-is. The thing you need to understand here is, we aren‚Äôt really calculating `30` using the formula `5 * 6`, but directly putting text `30` in here. That‚Äôs called **hard-coding**.

In a later step, we will look at how to actually calculate the value and pass it in.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Understood that displaying text on the console is not the same as printing an expression value
* Learned about the `print()` function, that is used to print text in Python.
* Found a way to print the text `"5 * 6 = 30"` on the console, by hard-coding values in a string

#### Step 07: Puzzles On Utility Methods, And Strings <a id="step-07-puzzles-on-utility-methods-and-strings"></a>

In the previous step, we learned how to print `5 * 6 = 30`. It was not a perfect solution, because we hard-coded everything. we used an in-built function named `print()`, passed a string to it, and invoked the method.

In this step, let‚Äôs look at a number of puzzles related to in-built methods, their parameters, and strings in general.

For example, let‚Äôs do `print("5 * 6")`, as in the previous step. What does this code result in?

```python
    >>> print("5*6")    5*6    >>> print('5*6')    5*6
```

It just prints the string `"5 * 6"`.

Let‚Äôs say we try the code `print(5 * 6)`,

```python
    >>> print(5*6)    30
```

Without the double quotes, `5 * 6` is an expression. What will be the output? `30`.

If you call `print()` with an expression argument, it prints the value of the expression. However, when we pass something within double quotes, it becomes a piece of text, printed as-is.

An interesting thing to note is, that in Python you can use either double-quotes \(`"` and `"`\), or single-quotes \(`'` and `'`\) with text values.

Let‚Äôs look at a few other in-built methods within Python.

Consider `abs()` \(which stands for absolute value\), a method that accepts a numeric value. You can use `abs(10.5)`, passing `10.5` as a value to it, and it prints the absolute value of `10`.

```python
    >>> abs 10.5      File "<stdin>", line 1        abs 10.5               ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax    >>> abs(10.5)    10.5
```

If you pass in a string value, will it work? It complains, ‚Äú`abs()` function will not work with a string, it only works with numeric values‚Äù.

```python
    >>> abs("10.5")    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>    TypeError: bad operand type for abs(): 'str'
```

Let‚Äôs say you want to use a function that computes ‚Äúto the power of‚Äù, for instance ‚Äú`2` to the power of `5`‚Äù. In Python, there‚Äôs an in-built function named `pow()`, which does just what we need. To `pow()`, you can pass two parameters and calculate the result. How do you do that?

Will this work: `pow 2 5`? No, not at all. This code does not work as well: `pow(2 5)`. `pow(2, 5)` is the correct syntax.

```python
    >>> pow 2 5      File "<stdin>", line 1        pow 2 5            ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax    >>> pow(2 5)      File "<stdin>", line 1        pow(2 5)              ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax    >>> pow(2, 5)    32
```

You‚Äôll see that `32` is printed.

Let‚Äôs see another example, ‚Äú`10` to the power of `3`‚Äù. `pow(10,3)` is the alternative to saying `10 ** 3`. This gives us `1000`, similar to how `pow()` would.

```python
    >>> pow(10, 3)    1000    >>> 10 ** 3    1000
```

`max()` returns maximum in a set of numbers.`min()` function returns the minimum value.

```python
    >>> max(34, 45, 67)    67    >>> min(34, 45, 67)    34
```

These are some of the in-built functions in Python, and we saw how to call the in-built functions by passing in a varied number of parameters.

Python is case sensitive. So let‚Äôs say I want of calculate `pow(2,5)`. So this would give me `32`. Now, what if I say capital `'P'` instead of small `'p'` here? `Pow(2,5)` would lead to an error.

```python
    >>> pow(2,5)    32    >>> Pow(2,5)    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>    NameError: name 'Pow' is not defined
```

The only things not case-sensitive in Python, are string values. Earlier we saw that the code `print("Hello")` displays the text `"Hello"`. Inside a string, the text can be in any case. Hence, `print("hello")` displays `"hello"` ,with a small `'h'`.

```python
    >>> print("Hello")    Hello    >>> print("hello")    hello    >>> print("hellO")    hellO    >>> print ( "hellO" )    hellO
```

However inside your code, you need to be very particular about the case of function names, class names, variable names, and the like.

In your code, whitespace does not really matter. You can add space here and here, and you would still get the same output. However, in case of strings, whitespace does matter.

If we say `print("hellO World")`, it would print `"hellO World"`, with a space in between. And if you do `print("hellO World")` with three spaces, it would print the same. In expressions, white-space does not affect the output.

```python
    >>> print ( "hellO World" )    hellO World    >>> print ( "hellO     World" )    hellO     World
```

The last thing we want to look at, is an **escape sequence**. Let‚Äôs say you want to print a double quote, `"`, in the code. If we were to do this: `print("Hello"")`, what would happen? The compiler says error!

```python
    >>> print("Hello"")      File "<stdin>", line 1        print("Hello"")                      ^    SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```

If you want to print a `"` inside a string, use an escape sequence. In Python, the symbol `'\'` is used as an **escape character**. On using `'\'` adjacent to the `"`, it prints `Hello"` \(notice the trailing `"`\). We have used the `'\'` to **escape** the `"`, by forming an _escape sequence_ `\"`.

```python
>>> print("Hello\"")Hello">>>
```

The other reason why you would want to use a `'\'` is to print a `<NEWLINE>`. If you want to print `"Hello World"`, but with `"Hello"` on one line and `"World"` on the next, `'\n'` is the escape sequence to use.

```python
    >>> print("Hello\nWorld")    Hello    World
```

The other important escape sequence is `'\t'`, which prints a `<TAB>` in the output. When you do `print("Hello\tWorld")`, you can see the tab-space between `"Hello"` and `"World"`.

```python
    >>> print("Hello\tWorld")    Hello   World
```

Another useful escape sequence is `\\` . If you want to print a `\` , then use the sequence `\\` . You would see that it prints `Hello\World` . Think about what would happen if we put six `\` . Yes you‚Äôre right! It would print this string: `"\\\"` .

```python
    >>> print("Hello\\World")    Hello\World    >>> print("Hello\\\\\\World")    Hello\\\World
```

One of the things with Python is, it does not matter whether you use double quotes or single quotes to enclose strings. There are some interesting, and useful ways of using a combination of both, within the same string. Have a look at this call: `print("Hello'World")`, and notice the output we get. In a similar way, the following code will be accepted and run by the Python system: `print('Hello"World')`.

```python
    >>> print('Hello"')    Hello"    >>> print("Hello'World")    Hello'World    >>> print("Hello\"World")    Hello"World    >>> print("Hello\"World")    Hello"World
```

The above two examples can be used as a tip by newbie programmers when they form string literals, and want to use them in their code:

* If the string literal contains one or more single quotes, then you can use double quotes to enclose it.
* However if the string contains one or more double quotes, then prefer to use single quotes to enclose it.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Explored a number of puzzles related to code involving:
  * Built-in functions for numeric calculations
  * The `print()` function to display expressions and strings
* Covered the following aspects of the above utilities:
  * Case-sensitive aspects of names and strings
  * The role played by whitespace
  * The escape character, and common escape sequences

#### Step 08: Formatted Output With print\(\) <a id="step-08-formatted-output-with-print"></a>

In the previous step, we learned how to print a hard-coded string, such as `"5 * 6 = 30"`.

In this step, let‚Äôs try to replace the hard-coded `30` with a computed value.

Let‚Äôs start with a simple scenario. Let‚Äôs say we want to place that calculated value within a string, and display it. How do we do that?

**Snippet-01: print\(\) Formatted Output**

`format()` method can be used to print formatted text.

Let‚Äôs see an example:

```python
    >>> print("VALUE".format(5*2))    VALUE
```

We were expecting `10` to be printed, but it‚Äôs actually printing `VALUE`.

How do we get `10` to be printed then?

```python
    >>> print("VALUE {0}".format(5*2))    VALUE 10
```

By having an open brace `{`, closed brace `}`, and and by putting the index of the value between them. Here, the value is the first parameter, and it‚Äôs index will be `0`.

`"VALUE {0}"` is what we need.

Let‚Äôs take another example. Suppose to the `format()` function, we pass three values: `10`, `20` and `30`.

Typically when we count positions or indexes, we start from `0`.

To print the first value, you need to pass in an index of `0`. To print the second value, pass an index of `1`.

```python
    >>> print("VALUE {0}".format(10,20,30))    VALUE 10    >>> print("VALUE {1}".format(10,20,30))    VALUE 20    >>> print("VALUE {2}".format(10,20,30))    VALUE 30
```

Now going back to our problem, we wanted to display `"5 * 6 = 30"`, but without hard-coding. Instead of `30`, we want the calculated value of `5 * 6`.

```python
    >>> print("5 * 6 = 30".format(5,6,5*6))    5 * 6 = 30
```

Let replace `"5 * 6 = 30"` with `"5 * 6 = {2}"`. `2` is the index of parameter value `5*6`.

```python
    >>> print("5 * 6 = {2}".format(5,6,5*6))    5 * 6 = 30
```

Cool! Progress made.

Let‚Äôs replace `5 * 6` with the right indices - `{0} * {1}`.

```python
    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,6,5*6))    5 * 6 = 30
```

The great thing about this, is now we can replace the values we passed to `print()` in the first place, without changing the indexes! So, we can display results for `5 * 7 = 35` and `5 * 8 = 40`. We are now able to print `5 * 6 = 30`, `5 * 7 = 35`, `5 * 8 = 40`, and can do similar things for other table entries as well.

```python
    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,7,5*7))    5 * 7 = 35    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,8,5*8))    5 * 8 = 40    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,8,5*8))    5 * 8 = 40
```

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Discovered that Python provides a way to do formatted printing of string values
* Looked at the `format()` function, and saw how to call it within `print()`
* Observed how we could work only with the indexes of parameters to `format()`, and change the parameters we pass without changing the code

#### Step 09: Puzzles On format\(\) and print\(\) <a id="step-09-puzzles-on-format-and-print"></a>

In this step, let‚Äôs look at a few puzzles related to the format, and the print methods.

**Snippet-01: format\(\) And print\(\) Puzzles**

Let‚Äôs say we pass in additional values, such as: `5 * 8`, `5 * 9` and `5 * 10`. However, within the call to `format()`, we are only referring to the values at index `0`, index `1` and index `2`. The values at indexes `3` and `4` are not used at all. What would happen when we run the code?

```python
    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,8,5*8,5*9,5*10))    5 * 8 = 40
```

Would this throw an error? No, it does not. You can see that the additional values which are passed in, are conveniently ignored.

Let‚Äôs say instead of passing in a value of `2`, we pass `4`. What would happen?

```python
    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {4}".format(5,8,5*8,5*9,5*10))    5 * 8 = 50
```

`5 * 10` is the value at index `4`

Now let‚Äôs take a different scenario. We remove all the parameters passed to `format()`. However, inside the call to `print()`, we continue to say `{0} * {1} = {4}`. So we are trying to print the value at index `4`, but are only passing two values to the function `format()`. What do you think will happen?

```python
    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {4}".format(5,8))    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>    IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

It says `IndexError`, which means :‚Äúyou are asking me to fetch the value at index `4`, but only passing in two values. How can I do what you want?‚Äù

Let‚Äôs look at a few more things related to other data types. We try to format the following inside `print()`: `{0} * {1} = {2}`, and would pass in `2.5`, `2`, and `2.5 * 2` . Here, `2` is an integer value, but `2.5` is a floating point value. You can see that it prints `2.5 * 2 = 5.0`. So this approach of formatting values with `print()`, works also with floating point data as well.

```python
    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(2.5,2,2.5*2))    2.5 * 2 = 5.0
```

Now, are there are other types of data that `format()` works with? Yes, strings can join the party.

Let‚Äôs say over here, we do: `print("My name is {0}".format("Ranga"))`. What would happen?

```python
    >>> print("My name is {0}".format("Ranga"))    My name is Ranga
```

Index `0` will be replaced with the first parameter to `format()`.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Understood the behavior when the parameters passed to `format()`:
  * Exceed the indexes accessed by `print()`
  * Are less than the indexes accessed by `print()`
  * Are of type integer, floating-point or string

#### Step 10: Introducing Variables <a id="step-10-introducing-variables"></a>

We are slowly making progress toward our main goal, which is to print the `5` multiplication table.

In the first statement, we are printing `5 * 1 = 5`, and then changing the literals. To make it print `5 * 2 = 10`, we are changing `1` to `2`. Next, we are changing `2` to `3`. How do we make it a little simpler, so that our effort is reduced?

```python
    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,1,5*1))    5 * 1 = 5    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,2,5*2))    5 * 2 = 10    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,3,5*3))    5 * 3 = 15
```

Let‚Äôs try a different approach.

What would happen if you replace `1` with `index`, and `5 * 1` with `5 * index`, and try to run it?

It gives an error! It says: ‚Äúindex is not defined‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs try and fix this, and execute `index = 2`. What would happen?

```python
    >>> index = 2
```

Aha! This compiles.

```python
    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 2 = 10
```

And this statement is printing `5 * 2 = 10`.

Let‚Äôs try something else. Let‚Äôs make `index = 3`. What would happen?

```python
    >>> index = 3    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 3 = 15
```

The same statement on being run, prints `5 * 3 = 15`.

How can you check the value that `index` has? Just type in `index`.

```python
    >>> index    3    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 3 = 15
```

The `index` symbol we have used here, is what is called a **variable**.

In Python, it‚Äôs also called a **name**.

You can see that the value `index` referring to, can change over the duration of a program.

Initially, `index` was referring to a value of `1`. later, `index` was referring to a value of `3`.

Now, think about how you would print the entire table. All that you need to do, is start from `1`, execute the same statement with `print()` and `format()`, to get output `5 * 1 = 5`. Next, Change the value of index to `2`, and then print the same statement. Next, `index = 3`, and print the same statement again.

```python
    >>> index = 1    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 1 = 5    >>> index = 2    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 2 = 10    >>> index = 3    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 3 = 15
```

With the same statement `print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))`, we are able to print different values. The value of `index` varies, but the code remains the same!

Variables make the program much more easier to read, as well as more generic.

**Snippet-02: Classroom Exercise On Variables**

Let‚Äôs do a simple exercise with variables.

We want to create three variables `a`, `b` and `c`. Let‚Äôs initially give them some values, say a value of `5` to `a`, `6` to `b` and `7` to `c`.

We want to get output of this kind: `5 + 6 + 7 = 18`, without using the literal values.

You would want to use the values stored in the variables in `a`, `b` and `c`.

If you‚Äôre hard-coding, the way to do it is with `print("5 + 6 + 7 = 18")`.

```python
    >>> a = 5    >>> b = 6    >>> c = 7    >>> print("5 + 6 + 7 = 18")    5 + 6 + 7 = 18    >>> print("5 + 6 + 7 = 18".format(a,b,c,a+b+c))    5 + 6 + 7 = 18
```

The way you can do that is with code like this: `print("{0} + {1} + {2} = {3}".format(a,b,c,a+b+c))`.

```python
    >>> print("{0} + {1} + {2} = {3}".format(a,b,c,a+b+c))    5 + 6 + 7 = 18
```

How do you confirm we are accessing values stored in the variables?

Let‚Äôs change the values of `a`, `b` and `c`. Let‚Äôs make `a = 6` , `b = 7` , and `c = 8` . Execute same statement.

```python
    >>> a = 6    >>> b = 7    >>> c = 8    >>> print("{0} + {1} + {2} = {3}".format(a,b,c,a+b+c))    6 + 7 + 8 = 21
```

You can see the magic of variables at play here! Based on what values these variables are referring to, you can see that the output of the print statement changes.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Were introduced to variables, or names, in Python
* Observed how we could pass in values of variables to the `format()` function

#### Step 11: Puzzles On Variables <a id="step-11-puzzles-on-variables"></a>

In the previous step, we were introduced to the concept of variables in Python.

We will start with looking at a few puzzles.

**Snippet-01: Puzzles On Variables**

What if I try to refer to a variable which is not yet created?

```python
    >>> count    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>    NameError: name 'count' is not defined    >>> print(count)    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>    NameError: name 'count' is not defined
```

Before using a variable, you need to have it assigned a value. If you have not defined a variable before, then you cannot use it. Consider `print(count)`, it does not know what count is. So it would throw an error, saying: ‚Äú`count` is not defined, I have no idea what count is.‚Äù

Once you assign a value to a variable, you can use it.

```python
    >>> count = 4    >>> print(count)    4
```

The statement `count = 4` where we are creating a variable named `count` for the first time, is called a **variable definition**.

This is the first time you‚Äôre referring to a variable, and assigning a value to it.

Python will create a variable in its memory.

Variable names are case sensitive. `count` and `Count` are not the same thing.

```python
    >>> Count    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>    NameError: name 'Count' is not defined    >>> count    4
```

There are rules to follow while naming variables.

All variable names should either start with an alphabet , or an underscore `_` . `count`, `_count` are valid. `1count` is invalid.

```python
    >>> 1count = 5      File "<stdin>", line 1        1count = 5             ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax    >>> count = 5    >>> _count = 5    >>> 1count      File "<stdin>", line 1        1count             ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax    >>> 2count      File "<stdin>", line 1        2count             ^    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

After the first symbol, you can also use a numeral in variable names.

```python
    >>> c12345 = 5
```

To summarize the rules for naming variables.

* This should start with an alphabet \(a capital or a small alphabet\) or underscore.
* Starting the second character, it can be alphabet, or underscore, or a numeric value.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Understood that a variable needs to be defined before it is used
* Learned that there are certain rules to be followed while giving names to variables

#### Step 12: Introducing Assignment <a id="step-12-introducing-assignment"></a>

In this step, we will look at an important concept in Python, called **assignment**. In previous steps, we created variables, like `i = 5`.

**Snippet-01: Introducing Assignment**

You can create other variables using whatever value `i` is referring to. If we say `j = i`, what would happen?

```python
    >>> i = 5    >>> j = i    >>> j    5
```

`j` would start referring to the same value that `i` is referring to. This statement is called an **assignment**.

Let‚Äôs try `j = 2 * i`.

```python
    >>> j = 2 * i    >>> j    10
```

`j` refers to a value of `10`

`=` has a different meaning in programming compared to mathematics.

In mathematics, When we execute `j = i`, it means `j` and `i` are equal.

In prgramming, the value of the expression on right hand side is assigned to the variable on the right hand side. Can you use a constant on the left hand side of an assignment? The answer is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù!

```python
    >>> 5 = j      File "<stdin>", line 1    SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
```

The Python Shell throws an error, saying ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt assign to literal‚Äù, as `5` is a literal.

Let‚Äôs create a couple of variables. `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 3`. We would want to add these and create a fresh variable. Let‚Äôs say the name of the variable is `sum`.

```python
    >>> num1 = 5    >>> num2 = 3    >>> sum = num1 + num2    >>> sum    8
```

Create 3 variables `a`, `b` and `c` with different values and calculate their sum.

```python
    >>> a = 5    >>> b = 6    >>> c = 7    >>> sum = a + b + c    >>> sum    18
```

We have just seen the mechanics of how assignment works in Python.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Learned what happens when you assign a value to a variable, which may or may not exist
* Discovered that literal constants cannot be placed on the left hand side of the assignment\(`=`\) operator

#### Step 13: Introducing Formatted Printing <a id="step-13-introducing-formatted-printing"></a>

Until now, we have been using the `format()` method to format and print values. Let‚Äôs see a better approach to printing values.

This is the approach we used until now.

```python
    >>> a = 1    >>> b = 2    >>> c = 3    >>> sum = a + b + c    >>> print("{0} + {1} + {2} = {3}".format(a, b, c ,sum))    1 + 2 + 3 = 6
```

Python has the concept of formatted strings. The syntax to use a formatted string is very simple - `f""`.

If we want to print the value of a variable `a`, we can use `{a}` in the text.

```python
    >>> print(f"")    >>> print(f"value of a is {a}")    value of a is 1    >>> print(f"value of b is {b}")    value of b is 2
```

The variable within braces is replaced by its value.

You can use expressions in a formatted string. Example below uses `{a+b}`.

```python
    >>> print(f"sum of a and b is {a + b}")    sum of a and b is 3
```

This feature was introduced in a Python 3 release.

Let‚Äôs get back to the original problem we wanted to solve: printing `5 + 6 + 7 = 18`, using formatted strings.

```python
    >>> print(f"{a} + {b} + {c} = {sum}")    1 + 2 + 3 = 6
```

You can see how easy it turns out to be!

#### Step 14: The PMT-Challenge Revisited <a id="step-14-the-pmt-challenge-revisited"></a>

We want to print the `5`-table from `5 * 1 = 5` onward, until we reach to `5 * 10 = 50`. The best solution we have right now, is shown below:

**Snippet-01:**

```python
    >>> index = 1    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 1 = 5    >>> index = 2    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 2 = 10    >>> index = 3    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 3 = 15    >>> index = 4    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 4 = 20
```

Can we do something, to make sure that the code remains the same all the time, but the `index` value gets updated?

```python
    >>> index = index + 1    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 5 = 25    >>> index = index + 1    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 6 = 30    >>> index = index + 1    >>> print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))    5 * 7 = 35
```

We used `index = index + 1` to increment `index` value.

If we execute these same two statements again and again, we can print the entire table! This is exactly what loops help us do: execute the same statements repeatedly.

The simplest loop available in Python is the **for loop**.

When we run a `for` loop, we need to specify the range of values - `1` to `10` or `1` to `20`, and so on. `range()` function helps us to specify a range of values.

```python
    >>> range(1,10)    range(1, 10)
```

The syntax of the `for` loop is: `for i in range(1, 10): ...`. Here, `i` is the name of the **control variable**. In Python, you need to put a colon, ‚Äò`:`‚Äô, and in the next line give indentation.

```python
    >>> for i in range(1,10):    ...   print(i)    ...    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
```

You would see that it prints from `1` to `9`.

When we run a loop in `range(1, 10)`, `1` is _inclusive_ and `10` is **exclusive**.The loop runs from `1` to the value before `10`, which is `9`.

The leading whitespace before `print(i)` is called **indentation**. We‚Äôll talk about indentation later, when we talk about puzzles related to the `for` loop.

How can you extend this concept to solving our _PMT-Challenge_ problem?

```python
    >>> print(f"{5} * {index} = {5*index}")    5 * 7 = 35
```

What we were doing earlier, was calling `print()` with a formatted string. Now we want to print this statement for different values of `i`.

How can you do that?

Let‚Äôs start with a simple example.

```python
    >>> for i in range(1,11):    ...   print(f"{i}")    ...    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10
```

`print(f"{i}")` prints the value of i.

Now, how do we get it to print `5 * 1 = 5` to `5 * 10 = 50`?

```python
    >>> for i in range(1,11):    ...   print(f"5 * {i} = {5 * i}")    ...    5 * 1 = 5    5 * 2 = 10    5 * 3 = 15    5 * 4 = 20    5 * 5 = 25    5 * 6 = 30    5 * 7 = 35    5 * 8 = 40    5 * 9 = 45    5 * 10 = 50    >>> 5 * 4 * 50    1000
```

`print(f"5 * {i} = {5 * i}")` prints a specific multiple of 5.

#### Step 15: Loops <a id="step-15-loops"></a>

In a previous step, we took a major step in programming. We wrote our first for loop with Python. In this step, let‚Äôs try a few puzzles to understand the for loop even further.

The syntax of the for loop we looked at earlier was:

```python
  for i in range(1, 10):    print(i)
```

**Snippet-01:**

Let‚Äôs say we write a `for` loop, but don‚Äôt give a `:` after the `range()` method, to close the first line. What would happen?

```python
    >>> for i in range(1,10)      File "<stdin>", line 1        for i in range(1,10)                           ^        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Invalid syntax. A `:` is mandatory within the `for` loop syntax.

Let‚Äôs provide a `:` and in the next line, use `print(i)` without space before it \(without indentation\).

```python
    >>> for i in range(1,10):    ... print(i)      File "<stdin>", line 2        print(i)            ^    IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

Most other programming languages use open brace `{` and closed brace `}` as delimiters in a `for` loop. However, Python uses indentation to identify which code is part of a `for` loop, and which is not. So if we are writing the body of a `for` loop, we must use indentation, and leave atleast a single `<SPACE>`.

```python
    >>> for i in range(1,10):    ...   print(i)    ...    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
```

How do we execute two lines of code as part of the `for` loop?

```python
    >>> for i in range(1,10):    ...  print(i)    ...  print(2*i)    ...    1    2    2    4    3    6    4    8    5    10    6    12    7    14    8    16    9    18
```

We are indenting both statements with a space - `print(i)` and `print(2*i)`.

When for loop has only one line of code, you can specify it right after the `:`

```python
    >>> for i in range(2,5): print(i)    ...    2    3    4
```

However, this is not considered to be a good programming practice. Even though you may want to execute just one statement in a `for` loop, indentation on a new line is recommended.

Another best practice is to use four `<SPACE>`s for indentation, instead of just two. This would give clear indentation of the code.

```python
    >>> for i in range(2,5):    ...     print(i)    ...    2    3    4
```

Anybody who looks at the code immediately understands that this `print()` is part of the `for` loop.

Let‚Äôs say you only want to print the odd numbers till `10`, which are `1`, `3`, `5`, `7` and `9`. The `range()` function offers an interesting option.

```python
    >>> for i in range (1,11,2):    ...   print(i)    ...    1    3    5    7    9
```

In `for i in range(1, 11, 2)`, we pass in a third argument, called a _step_. After each iteration, the value of `i` is increment by `step`.

**Summary**

In this step, we:

* Looked at a few puzzles about the `for` loop, which lay emphasis on the following aspects of for:
  * The importance of syntax elements such as the colon
  * Indentation
  * Variations of the `range()` function

#### Step 16: Programming Exercise PE-BA-02 <a id="step-16-programming-exercise-pe-ba-02"></a>

In the previous step, after initially exploring the Python `for` loop, we looked at a number of puzzles.

In this step, let‚Äôs look at a few exercises.

**Exercises**

1. Print the even numbers up to 10. We would want to print 2 4 6 8 10, using a for loop.
2. Print the first 10 numbers in reverse
3. Print the first 10 even numbers in reverse
4. Print the squares of the first 10 numbers
5. Print the squares of the first 10 numbers, in reverse
6. Print the squares of the even numbers

**Solution 1**

Instead of starting with `1`, we need to start with `2`. Each time, `i` it would be incremented by `2`, and `2 4 6 8 and 10` would be printed.

```python
    >>> for i in range (2,11,2):    ...   print(i)    ...    2    4    6    8    10
```

**Solution 2**

We would want to print the numbers in reverse. Think about how you would do that using the `range()` function. We‚Äôd want go from `10`, `9`, `8`, and so on up to `1`.

```python
    >>> for i in range (10,0,-1):    ...   print(i)    ...    10    9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1
```

The value to start with is `10`. As we discussed earlier, the end value is exclusive. So to print from `10` to `1`, we want to end one value which is `0`. `range(10, 0)` seems to be what we need.

Usually these step value is positive, but we need to go backwards from `10`. Hence, we would give a step value of `-1`.

**Solution 3**

Now, let‚Äôs print the first `10` even numbers in reverse.

```python
    >>> for i in range (20,0,-2):    ...   print(i)    ...    20    18    16    14    12    10    8    6    4    2
```

**Solution 4**

Next, we would want to print the squares of the first 10 numbers.

```python
    >>> for i in range (1,11):    ...     print(i * i)    ...    1    4    9    16    25    36    49    64    81    100
```

**Solution 5**

Let‚Äôs print the squares in the reverse order.

```python
    >>> for i in range (10,0,-1):    ...     print(i*i)    ...    100    81    64    49    36    25    16    9    4    1
```

**Solution 6**

Print the squares of the even numbers. How to do that?

```python
    >>> for i in range (10,0,-2):    ...     print(i*i)    ...    100    64    36    16    4
```

The key part is using a step of `-2`

We leave it as an exercise for you, to print squares of odd numbers.

**Summary**

In this video, we: \* Tried out a few exercises involving the for loop, by playing around with printing sequences of numbers.

* Used the for loop to simplify the solution to the _PMT-Challenge_ problem.

#### Step 17: Review: The Basics Of Python <a id="step-17-review-the-basics-of-python"></a>

It must have been a roller-coaster ride to solve the multiplication table challenge so far. If you‚Äôre new to programming, there are a wide range of topics and concepts, that you would have learned during this small journey.

Let‚Äôs quickly revise the important concepts we have learned during this small journey.

* `1`, `11`, `5`, ‚Ä¶ are all called literals because these are constant values. Their values don‚Äôt really change. \_Consider ``5 _ 4 _ 50`. This is an expression. `_`is an operator, and`5`, `4`and`50`` are operands.
* The name `i` in `i = 1`, is called a variable. It can refer to different values, at different points in time.
* `range()` and `print()` are in-built Python functions.
* Every complete line of code is called statement. The specific statement `print()`, is invoking a method. The other statement which we looked at earlier, was an assignment statement. `index = index + 1` would evaluate `index + 1`, and have the `index` variable refer to that value.
* The syntax of the `for` loop was very simple. `for var in range(1, 10) : ...`, followed by statements you would want to execute in a loop, with indentation. For the sake of indentation we left four `<SPACE>`s in front of each statement inside the `for` loop.

So that, in a nutshell, is what we have learned over the course of our first section.
