The playoff series was the fifth to feature the\_[Devils–Rangers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils%E2%80%93Rangers_rivalry).&#xA;&#xA;\n\n### Jerseys\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Jersey_Devils\\&action=edit\\&section=11)]\n\nThe team colors are red, black and white, and they can be seen on both the home and road jerseys. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until the NHL swapped home and road colors in 2003,[\\[162\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-162)\_is dominantly red in color. There are three black and white stripes, one across each arm and one across the waist. The road jersey (the team's former home jersey) is white in color with a similar design, except that the three stripes are black and red. The shoulders are draped with black on both uniforms. Before the\_[1992–93](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992%E2%80%9393\\_New_Jersey_Devils_season)\_season, the uniforms were green and red with slightly different striping,[\\[163\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-sportsnj-163)\_leading some fans to affectionately refer to them as \"Christmas colors.\"[\\[164\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-164)\_The Devils have yet to introduce a\_[third jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_jersey)\_and are one of only two NHL teams (Detroit is the other) never to have worn one.[\\[165\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-165)\_Lamoriello had stated that he did not ever intend to introduce a third jersey for the Devils, saying, \"I don't believe in it\", Lamoriello said. \"I strongly believe that you have to have one identity as a team. We want to create a feeling that our home and away jerseys are special and that it means something special to wear one.\"[\\[166\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-166)\_Unlike most teams, the Devils kept the same uniform design when the NHL switched to the\_[Rbk Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_uniform#RSince\\_2007:\\_Reebok_Edge)\_jerseys by\_[Reebok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reebok)\_for the\_[2007–08 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308\\_NHL_season).[\\[167\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-167)\n\nOn August 20, 2009, Lamoriello announced that the Devils would wear their classic red, white and green jerseys on their\_[Saint Patrick's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Day)\_2010 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lamoriello stated, \"The original red, green and white jerseys are a part of our history here in New Jersey. We have always been an organization that takes great pride in its tradition. This is something we believe our fans will enjoy for that one special night.\"[\\[168\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-168)\_Martin Brodeur wore a special replica helmet of the one from his first NHL game.[\\[169\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-169)[\\[170\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-170)\_The throwback jerseys continued to be used, including for games on or around St. Patrick's Day over three different seasons and in the\_[2014 NHL Stadium Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014\\_NHL_Stadium_Series)\_against the Rangers, on January 26.[\\[171\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-171)\n\nOn June 20, 2017, the Devils revealed their new uniforms for the 2017–18 season.[\\[172\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-172)\_Made by Adidas, the new sweaters are the first major change to the team's look since they replaced green with black. They feature the removal of the stripes on the bottom of the sweater, and also thicker sleeve stripes with equal width bands of white and black.[\\[173\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-173)\n\nThe Devils wore their classic white, red and green uniforms for four home games in the 2018–19 season.[\\[174\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-174)\n\nThe Devils rolled out a \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform in collaboration with Adidas during the 2020–21 season. The team used the original uniform template worn from 1982 to 1992, but green served as the base color instead of red.[\\[175\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-175)\n\n### Logo\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Jersey_Devils\\&action=edit\\&section=12)]\n\nThe Devils' logo is a\_[monogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogram)\_of the letters \"N\", and \"J\", rendered with devil horns at the top of the \"J\" and a pointed tail at the bottom. The monogram was red with a green outline when the team began playing in New Jersey, but the outline color was changed to black in 1992, due to difficulties in making the green color consistent between its logo and jerseys. The logo sits inside an open black circle, and lies on a field of white in the middle of the chest on both uniforms.[\\[176\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-176)\_Before the Devils' move from Colorado in 1982, then-owner John McMullen's wife designed a prototype logo, which was then modified by a professional graphic design and marketing firm, and became the green-and-red logo used by the team for the first ten years in New Jersey.[\\[177\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-177)\n\n### Mascot\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Jersey_Devils\\&action=edit\\&section=13)]\n\nThe mascot is \"NJ Devil\", a 7-foot (2.1\_m) tall devil who plays into the myth of the\_[Jersey Devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Devil). NJ Devil keeps the crowd excited, signs autographs, participates in entertainment during the intermissions, skates across the ice, throws T-shirts and runs throughout the aisles of the arena to high five fans.[\\[178\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-178)\_Prior to 1993, the mascot was \"Slapshot\", a large Devils\_[hockey puck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck)\_that interacted with the fans. The man inside the costume resigned after he was accused of touching three women inappropriately while in costume. The man agreed to undergo psychological counseling for a year as part of his agreement to avoid trial.[\\[179\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-179)\_To remove the stigma of the lawsuit, Slapshot was retired and has not returned since.[\\[180\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-180)\n\n### Traditions\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Jersey_Devils\\&action=edit\\&section=14)]\n\n[Arlette Roxburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlette_Roxburgh)\_has been the team's primary national anthem singer at home games since 1996 and is a favorite among Devils fans. Pete Cannarozzi has been the team's organist since 2001. His organ playing has been instrumental in bridging the Devils’ tradition from the\_[Meadowlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadowlands_Arena)\_to\_[Prudential Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudential_Center). In addition to playing during breaks in play and at the end of a period, he also provides Arlette or another local performer with accompanying music during the national anthem.[\\[181\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-181)\n\nSome of Prudential Center's most vociferous fans can be found in Sections 233 and 122, home to groups of Devils fans whom self-identify as the Crazies and the Diablos, respectively. The 233 Crazies were originally created in 1993 as the 228 Crazies at the Meadowlands. They are known for their custom, triple-digit Devils jerseys reflecting their section number with “CRAZIES” on the nameplate, and are the source of many chants and generally enthusiastic behavior. A handful of 233 Crazies typically attend every Devils home game and some road games as well.[\\[182\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-182)\_The Diablos of Section 122 were originally conceived in part by the Devils’ management in 2011 by extending a special season ticket offer to and actively seeking input from fans seeking to participate in a European-style\_[supporters’ section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporters%27\\_groups)\_similar to those popular in\_[Major League Soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer),[\\[183\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-183)\_ultimately in an effort to liven-up in the in-arena atmosphere following a poor campaign on the ice. While the Diablos have ultimately ceased to be supported directly by the organization and the following ownership group has focused on different methods of enhancing the fan experience, Section 122 and its general vicinity continues to be a source of more raucous behavior and general hostility towards opposing teams.\n\nMark Baumann, simply known to fans by his last name, Baumann, is a long-time season ticket holder familiar to many Devils fans for starting the D-E-V-I-L-S chant, dating back to 1995. He commonly wears a white Devils jersey with his name and the number 00.[\\[184\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-184)\n\n### Rivalries\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Jersey_Devils\\&action=edit\\&section=15)]\n\nThe Devils developed strong rivalries with two teams out of geographical proximity and frequent playoff confrontations. The\_[\"Battle of the Hudson River\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils%E2%80%93Rangers_rivalry)\_with the New York Rangers is so-called as the Devils' arenas in the\_[New York metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area)\_were always less than ten miles and across the Hudson River from\_[Madison Square Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden).[\\[185\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-RivalRangers-185)\_New Jersey's proximity with Pennsylvania also led to a rivalry with the Philadelphia Flyers, the \"[Battle of the Jersey Turnpike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils%E2%80%93Flyers_rivalry).\" The Flyers have a large following in\_[South Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey)\_and train in\_[Voorhees Township](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voorhees_Township,\\_New_Jersey). Both teams had the most titles of the Atlantic Division prior to the 2013 realignment, with nine to the Devils and six to the Flyers.[\\[186\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-186)\n\n### Style of play\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Jersey_Devils\\&action=edit\\&section=16)]\n\nThe Devils have been known as a defense-first team since head coach Jacques Lemaire's first tenure,[\\[187\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-187)\_although the Devils have twice led the Eastern Conference in goals scored, once leading the NHL in goals scored (295 goals for in 2000–01).[\\[188\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-188)[\\[189\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-189)\_Lemaire gave the Devils their defensive mantra when he implemented a system commonly called the \"[neutral zone trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_zone_trap).\"[\\[190\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-190)\_This system is designed to force teams to turn over the puck in the neutral zone leading to a counterattack.[\\[191\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-191)\_This style of play led the team to be chastised by the media and hockey purists for \"making the NHL boring.\"[\\[192\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-192)\_Nevertheless, the Devils were successful using this style of play, and Devils head coach Larry Robinson asserted that the Montreal Canadiens teams he played on in the 1970s (who also won the Cup many times) used a form of the trap, though it did not have a name.[\\[193\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-193)\n\nUnder head coach Brent Sutter, the team adopted less of a trap and more of a transitional, aggressive forechecking style of play which also emphasized puck possession and instilled the cycle to start the 2007–08 season.[\\[194\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-pressure-194)\_This led to many high scoring games early in the season for New Jersey. The Devils went on to score 244 goals in the 2008–09 season, the most the team had scored in eight seasons.[\\[195\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-195)\_However, with the return of Lemaire as head coach, the Devils resumed a more defense-oriented playing style, scoring just 222 goals and allowing only 191, an NHL best in the 2009–10 season, earning Martin Brodeur his fifth\_[William M. Jennings Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M.\\_Jennings_Trophy).[\\[196\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-196)\n\nLemaire has since re-entered retirement, and was replaced by former Florida head coach Peter DeBoer on July 19, 2011. The team showed greater offensive prowess during the 2011–12 season, employing a more aggressive forecheck centered on Ilya Kovalchuk.[\\[197\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-197)[\\[198\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-198)\_Under DeBoer's system, according to Lamoriello, the Devils' defenseman were often sent into the offensive zone to apply pressure on the opposing team's defense.[\\[199\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-199)\_After DeBoer's dismissal, Adam Oates had a similar approach improving the Devils' offense, investing on the versatility of the forwards.[\\[136\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils#cite_note-oates-136)\n"
