Each static page with HTML and JavaScript is a micro frontend. And they can use any REST API, including the one built on the\_[microservices\_](https://relevant.software/blog/microservices-on-aws/)architecture.\n\n### JAM stands for JavaScript, API &\_Markup.\n\n> *“A modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup”*\n\n> *— Mathias Biilmann (CEO & Co-founder of Netlify).*\n\n#### JavaScript\n\nDynamic functionalities are handled by JavaScript. There is no restriction on which framework or library you must use.\n\n#### APIs\n\nServer side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third party services or your custom function.\n\n#### Markup\n\nWebsites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator.\n\n### Terminology:\n\n### API\n\nAPI is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. It defines interactions that allows two applications to talk to each other.\n\n### What is the use\_case?\n\n### JAMstack while not suffering from a shortage of virtues is not a one size fits all solution!\n\n#### Don’t use JAMstack\_when:\n\n*   You don’t generally do anything that consumes enough volume of static assets to cause your application to struggle with performance at least sometimes.\n\n*   Your development team is used to different tech, and the cost of migration is higher than the reward.\n\n*   You are dealing with tons of real-time/user data, (i.e. audio or video processing in real time)\n\n*   In most cases, it does not make sense to migrate a legacy project that is functioning just fine with no signs of depreciation on the horizon.\n\n### What is Jamstack?\n\nJamstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale.The core tenants of\_[pre-rendering](https://jamstack.org/glossary/pre-render), and\_[decoupling](https://jamstack.org/glossary/decoupling), enable sites and applications to be delivered with greater confidence and resilience than ever before.\n\nExplore more of the\_[benefits of Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack).\n\n### Pre-rendering\n\nWith Jamstack, the entire front end is prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets during a build process. This process of pre-rendering results in sites which can be served directly from a\_[CDN](https://jamstack.org/glossary/cdn/), reducing the cost, complexity and risk, of dynamic servers as critical infrastructure.\n\nWith so many popular tools for generating sites, like\_[Gatsby](https://jamstack.org/generators/gatsby/),\_[Hugo](https://jamstack.org/generators/hugo/),\_[Jekyll](https://jamstack.org/generators/jekyll/),\_[Eleventy](https://jamstack.org/generators/eleventy/),\_[NextJS](https://jamstack.org/generators/next/),\_[and very many more](https://jamstack.org/generators/), many web developers are already familiar with the tools needed to become productive Jamstack developers.\n\n### Enhancing with JavaScript\n\nWith the\_[markup](https://jamstack.org/glossary/markup/)\_and other user interface assets of Jamstack sites served directly from a CDN, they can be delivered very quickly and securely. On this foundation, Jamstack sites can use JavaScript and APIs to talk to backend services, allowing experiences to be enhanced and personalized.\n\n### Supercharging with\_services\n\nThe thriving\_[API economy](https://jamstack.org/glossary/api-economy/)\_has become a significant enabler for Jamstack sites. The ability to leverage domain experts who offer their products and service via APIs has allowed teams to build far more complex applications than if they were to take on the risk and burden of such capabilities themselves. Now we can outsource things like authentication and identity, payments, content management, data services, search, and much more.\n\nJamstack sites might utilise such services at build time, and also at run time directly from the browser via JavaScript. And the clean\_[decoupling](https://jamstack.org/glossary/decoupling/)\_of these services allows for greater portability and flexibility, as well as significantly reduced risk.\n\nThe real power of JAMstack development is easiest to grasp when compared with CMS-driven dynamic websites. It’s easy to forget the sheer number of steps required to fulfill a single page request, and the complexity of the operations that are constantly performed on the server to generate the final HTML received by the user’s browser.\n\nWhen a user requests a page, your server queries a MySQL database and uses a PHP interpreter, combined with data from the active theme and plugins, to stitch together an HTML document which can then be served to the user’s browser. What this extraordinarily complex operation amounts to, in essence, is\_**templating**. Given that even a modest blog is far too complex to code every page by hand, this method of dividing content into reusable components and automating the assembly makes sense.\n\nBut why does this templating operation need to happen on the server? Do we\_*really*\_need databases and server-side software (which opens up dozens of security holes along the way) just to create a simple blog? At a time when browsers themselves have become operating systems, capable of interacting with countless APIs and running complex applications client-side, and when front-end development is dominated by JavaScript-based automation using npm, haven’t we outgrown this model?\n\nStatic site generators like Jekyll and Hugo are part of what makes this possible. They essentially replace PHP as our templating system, but instead of running on a server and generating content on-the-fly, they\_**run locally**\_as part of your development process. Your HTML is generated up-front, and your website — now a collection of easily-cached static files — can be distributed to users by a blisteringly fast CDN (content distribution network).\n\n> [-source](https://builtvisible.com/go-static-try-jamstack/)\n\n### Common Features Of The Jamstack Workflow:\n\n#### Content delivery\_network\n\nSince all the markup and assets are pre-built, they can be served via CDN. This provides better performance and easier scalability.\n\n#### Atomic deploys\n\nEach deploy is a full snapshot of the site. This helps guarantee a consistent version of the site globally.\n\n#### Cache invalidation\n\nOnce your build is uploaded, the CDN invalidates its cache. This means that your new build is live in an instant.\n\n#### Everything in version\_control\n\nYour codebase lives in Version Control System, such as Git. The main benefits are: change history of every file, collaborators and traceability.\n\n#### Automated builds\n\nYour server is notified when a new build is required, typically via webhooks. Server builds the project, updates the CDNs and the site is live.\n\n### Getting started\n\n#### DEVELOPMENT\n\nHowever you decide to generate your HTML assets is up to you. The three most common approaches are:\n\n#### Hand coding\n\nSimple and effective method of writing HTML, it’s ideal for super simple pages.\n\n#### Static Site Generators\n\nMost JAMstack sites are powered by a static site generator. There’s no enforcement on which SSG you decide to use.\n\n*   [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)\n\n*   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n\n*   [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)\n\n#### Frontend Framework\n\nMost frameworks don’t output static HTML files, however it is possible to do that but it requires more tooling experience and maintenance.\n\n*   [React](http://reactjs.org/)\n\n*   [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)\n\n### DEPLOYMENT\n\nYour built site needs to be hosted somewhere. There are great services that provides this for free and with ease.\n\n*   [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)\n\n*   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)\n\n*   [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)\n\n### DYNAMIC PARTS\n\nJAMstack websites don’t have to be static. There are great services available to help bring some dynamic data to your product.\n\n#### Custom functions\n\nYou can also abstract your own functions into reusable APIs. For this you can use\_[AWS lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/features/)\_or\_[Netlify Functions](https://functions.netlify.com/examples/)\n\n#### Custom data\n\nAs you add features to your site, you may want to store user profiles, shopping cart data, game levels, or other dynamic data. Get started for free with\_[FaunaDB Serverless GraphQL](https://fauna.com/)\n\n#### Comments\n\nMany JAMstack products have dynamic comment sections. These are typically used on blogs\n\n#### Forms\n\nA great way to interact with your audience\n\n#### E-Commerce\n\nSetting up an online store on the JAMstack has never been easier\n\n#### Search\n\nRely on third party services to integrate a search functionality\n\n### CMS\n\nJAMstack sites can also be controlled via a Content Management System, these are typically known as Headless CMS. Once a change in the CMS is made, a new build of your site will be triggered and then deployed as static assets.\n\n*   [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)\n\n*   [Contentful](http://contentful.com/)\n\n*   [Headless WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)\n\n*   [Ghost](https://docs.ghost.org/api/content/)\n\n*   [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)\n\n*   [Forestry](https://forestry.io/)\n\n*   [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)\n\n*   [Kontent](https://www.kontent.ai/)\n\n*   [GraphCMS](http://graphcms.com/)\n\n*   [TakeShape](https://www.takeshape.io/)\n\n### Best Practice:\n\n*   **Using CDNs for hosting.**\_Using content delivery networks improves performance and scalability.\n\n*   **Atomic deploys.**\_Deploying lots of static files can be time-consuming. But with atomic deploys, you can forget about downtimes. Your app is always available to users, even when a new deployment is being executed. Besides, with each deploy being a full snapshot of your website, it guarantees global consistency.\n\n*   **Instant cache invalidation.**\_CDNs store sites in their local caches. Thus, when you change something on your website, your CDN invalidates the affected files and replaces them with the new ones. However, the process can take hours. To avoid this, it’s recommended to choose CDNs with instant cache validation.\n\n*   **Version control systems**. A version control system, such as\_[Git](https://git-scm.com/), is a cloud for your code. It hosts your source code, keeps track of all changes, and streamlines collaboration. If a mistake is made, developers can easily compare the current code from its previous versions and identify the cause.\n\n*   **Automated builds.**\_In terms of web development, build is a process of converting files and other assets into a final software product ready for deployment. Automating this process eliminates the risk of variation and defects.

          # Break Even Nuclear Fusion Candidate
          In December, researchers at the Joint European Torus (JET) started
          conducting fusion experiments with tritium — a rare and radioactive
          isotope of hydrogen. The facility is a one-tenth-volume mock-up of the
          US$22-billion ITER project and has the same doughnut-shaped 'tokamak'
          design — the world's most developed approach to fusion energy. It is
          the first time since 1997 that researchers have done experiments in a
          tokamak with any significant amount of tritium.
