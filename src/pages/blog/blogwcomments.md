excerpt: "## A **database is a collection of data organized for easy retrieval and manipulation**.   We're concerned only with digital databases, those that run on computers or other electronic devices. Digital databases have been around since the 1960s. Relational databases, those which store \"related\" data, are the oldest and most common type of database in use today.  ### **Data Persistence**  A database is often necessary because our application or code requires data persistence. This term refers to data that is infrequently accessed and not likely to be modified. In less technical terms, the information will be safely stored and remain untouched unless intentionally modified.  A familiar example of non-persistent data would be JavaScript objects and arrays, which reset each time the code runs.  ### **Relational Databases**  In relational databases, **the data is stored in tabular format grouped into rows and columns** (similar to spreadsheets). A collection of rows is called a table. Each row represents a single record in the table and is made up of one or more columns.  These kinds of databases are relational because a\_*relation*\_is a mathematical idea equivalent to a table. So relational databases are databases that store their data in tables."
