excerpt: "## **Overview**  A\_**database schema**\_is the shape of our database. It defines what tables we'll have, which columns should exist within the tables and any restrictions on each column.  A well-designed database schema keeps the data well organized and can help ensure high-quality data.  Note that while schema design is usually left to Database Administrators (DBAs), understanding schema helps when designing APIs and database logic. And in a smaller team, this step may fall on the developer."
